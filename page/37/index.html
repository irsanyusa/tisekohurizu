Rescuers discovered two emaciated horses in at least three feet of waste at a neglected farm in Maryland. The Humane Society of Washington County was alerted of the horses last Friday and rescuers took them to the Days End Farm Horse Rescue to recover, according to WUSA in Washington.

<a href=../../best-game-of-thrones-fashion-moments.html></a>
Game of Thrones may be a tale of fire and ice, but it’s also a tale that’s served some serious looks over the course of its soon-to-be eight seasons. From the heavy winter furs sported by Jon Snow and the Starks in the North to the ethereal dresses (and later, Dothraki warrior leather ensembles) favored by Daenerys Targaryen, there was fashion to be found in all the Seven Kingdoms.
While many of the style choices were practical, especially when it came to region (one would hardly wear a fur while living in Dorn) or occasion, clothing was also a strong way to show the evolution of a character and their relationship to power and the Iron Throne — Cersei’s cropped hair and black leather gowns after taking the throne as the Queen of the Andals and the First Men might be the most prescient example of this.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Baby Name: How Popular Was Your Name When You Were Born?</h2><time>Jul 30, 2024</time>

Let’s face it: not many people come to Thailand for the museums. Bangkok’s thousands of night-life venues are high on the list of attractions, but fewer visitors feel an obligation to view the antiquities at the national museums in Bangkok or Chiang Mai. This is due in part to the upstaging of Thai civilization by the Khmer; for many tourists to Southeast Asia, Cambodia with its temples at Angkor is the cultural must-see.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Sally Rooney's New Book 'Normal People' Is a Modern Romance</h2><time>Jul 30, 2024</time>
<a href=../../sally-rooney-normal-people-review.html></a>
Irish author Sally Rooney staked her claim as the first great novelist of the Millennial generation with her stunning 2017 debut, Conversations With Friends, which tells the story of a bisexual communist who expresses the emotions she can’t in person through emails and texts. That novel offers a nuanced portrait of modern romance, yet it closes on a surprisingly traditional, upbeat note — suggesting that our most familiar tropes die hard.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/36/>← Prev Page</a>
