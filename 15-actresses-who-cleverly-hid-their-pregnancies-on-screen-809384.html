Playing the baker’s wife who longs for a&nbsp;child might have been the perfect role for Emily Blunt in&nbsp;Into the Woods, given that she was carrying her daughter, Hazel, in&nbsp;her belly while filming the musical."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Sarah Jessica Parker in&nbsp;<i>Sex and the City</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c26/106/5337f95915835f02a274082f2c.jpg><p>HBO / Courtesy Everett Collection / East News<span>, </span>CJ Contino / Everett Collection / East News</p><p>There was a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reason</a> why the fifth season of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Sex and the City</i></a> only had 8&nbsp;episodes, and it’s mainly because of&nbsp;the lead actress, <a href=# title="Sarah Jessica Parker" data-link=tag>Sarah Jessica Parker</a>, who plays fashionista writer Carrie Bradshaw. She became pregnant with her son, James Wilkie, while shooting the series.</p><p>However, the costume department came to&nbsp;the rescue and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dressed</a> her in&nbsp;baggy, loose clothes and covered her belly with Birkin bags. In&nbsp;fact, there were 2&nbsp;moms-to-be on&nbsp;set, as&nbsp;her co-star, Cynthia Nixon, was also pregnant with her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>son</a>, Charles Ezekiel.</p><p><h2>3. Penélope Cruz in&nbsp;<i>Pirates of&nbsp;the Caribbean: On&nbsp;Stranger Tides</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a38/d8e/48b1b75f13b21f5b34a64385c9.jpg><p>East News<span>, </span>AP / East News</p><p>Penélope Cruz could have easily given up&nbsp;on&nbsp;the swashbuckling adventure in&nbsp;the fourth installment of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Pirates of&nbsp;the Caribbean</i></a><i>.</i> Still, she persisted and went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;play Angelica, a&nbsp;female pirate, despite being <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pregnant</a> with her son, Leo.</p><p>Luckily, her family had her back, as&nbsp;her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sister</a> Monica became her body double to&nbsp;hide her baby bump in&nbsp;wide shots and sword fights. “Monica came at&nbsp;the end to&nbsp;do&nbsp;some scenes. She’s a&nbsp;dancer and very good with a&nbsp;sword because she’s done a&nbsp;film herself,” she said.</p><p><h2>4. Kate Winslet in&nbsp;<i>Divergent</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/064/5e3/ad15035a3f925f81511cedb104.jpg><p>There almost wasn’t a&nbsp;scene in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Divergent</i></a> where <a href=# title="Kate Winslet" data-link=tag>Kate Winslet</a>’s character, Jeanine, can be&nbsp;seen without a&nbsp;folder or&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tablet</a> held in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;her. This was because she was already 5&nbsp;months pregnant with her son, Bear Blaze, while shooting her close-up scenes.</p><p>The production team got a&nbsp;little creative and went with giving her an&nbsp;iPad to&nbsp;cover her bump. Despite being in&nbsp;her second trimester, Winslet still insisted and did some of&nbsp;her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stunts</a>, and director Neil Burger was blown away by&nbsp;her professionalism.</p><p><h2>5. Reese Witherspoon in&nbsp;<i>Vanity Fair</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a1d/916/a479d7536ca34be13d5d2928d6.jpg><p>Regency-period London fashion was truly meant for <a href=# title="Reese Witherspoon" data-link=tag>Reese Witherspoon</a> while she filmed the period drama <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Vanity Fair</i></a>. She was 5&nbsp;months into her pregnancy with her son, Deacon, and the production team strategically <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hid</a> her growing belly by&nbsp;donning her in&nbsp;voluminous layers of&nbsp;dresses and hiding her behind cleverly positioned furniture, which was all uncannily appropriate for the time.</p><p><h2>6. Gillian Anderson in&nbsp;<i>The X-Files</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/652/abe/69a0ae53ee8a176b01d93883ba.jpg><p>East News<span>, </span>Grant Pollard / Invision / AP / East News</p><p>When Gillian Anderson found out she was pregnant with her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>daughter</a>, Piper Maru, she was in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;shooting the second season of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The X-Files</i></a>. However, the show’s writers just went with it&nbsp;and wrote a&nbsp;whole new storyline to&nbsp;give her more screen time with a&nbsp;covered bump. In&nbsp;its final episodes, her character, Dana Scully, can be&nbsp;seen with sheets over her as&nbsp;she was being “abducted” by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>aliens</a>.</p><p><h2>7. Lisa Kudrow in&nbsp;<i>Friends</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/537/29a/e3b6f05b0f89a85e455543a897.jpg><p>As&nbsp;you’d expect from a&nbsp;decade-long hit&nbsp;TV show, many things happened behind the scenes of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Friends</i></a>. One significant moment was Lisa Kudrow becoming pregnant with her son, Julian. Instead of&nbsp;concealing her bump for the rest of&nbsp;seasons 4&nbsp;and&nbsp;5, a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>storyline</a> was created to&nbsp;accommodate her pregnancy.</p><p>On-screen, she acted as&nbsp;a&nbsp;surrogate of&nbsp;triplets for her character’s brother and his wife. Behind the scenes, her co-stars fully supported her journey. “When I&nbsp;was pregnant, they would say, ’Have a&nbsp;great show, love you, love you&nbsp;— love you, little Julian!’ Cause we&nbsp;knew it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;boy and that was his name. So&nbsp;sweet, they included my&nbsp;little fetus in&nbsp;the huddle[s],” Kudrow <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><p><h2>8. Mindy Kaling in&nbsp;<i>The Mindy Project</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/495/dbe/37cc105e26b46b8bde1501c4a2.jpg><p>It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;miss that the leading lady of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Mindy Project</i></a> and her alter-ego, Mindy Lahiri, didn’t get pregnant at&nbsp;the same time. Kaling’s on-screen character went through her pregnancy journey in&nbsp;the third <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>season</a> of&nbsp;the show, while in&nbsp;real life, she carried her daughter, Katherine, in&nbsp;her belly during the final season.</p><p>To&nbsp;remedy the situation, the wardrobe team invested in&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;bags and purses and placed various <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>objects</a> intentionally in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;Kaling’s tummy.</p><p><h2>9. Gal Gadot in&nbsp;<i>Wonder Woman</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3e2/8cd/3c787c5ead841819eb4eb4a981.jpg><p>East News<span>, </span>AFP / EAST NEWS</p><p>While playing the Amazonian warrior in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Wonder Woman</i></a>, <a href=# title="Gal Gadot" data-link=tag>Gal Gadot</a> found out she was pregnant with her second daughter, Maya. But instead of&nbsp;backing down, she channeled her inner superhero and convinced the production team to&nbsp;conjure several <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ways</a> to&nbsp;conceal her 5-month bump, including placing some green fabric on&nbsp;her belly.</p><p><h2>10. Blake Lively in&nbsp;<i>The Shallows</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cec/cdc/f47764578abe31d274e2421d71.jpg><p>Image supplied by Capital Pictures / EAST NEWS<span>, </span>PacificCoastNews / EAST NEWS</p><p><a href=# title="Blake Lively" data-link=tag>Blake Lively</a>’s bikini body had&nbsp;us assuming she wasn’t pregnant while filming <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Shallows,</i></a> but the joke was clearly on&nbsp;us. While <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>filming</a> the action-heavy shark chases, she was already on&nbsp;her way to&nbsp;welcoming her second daughter, Ines. The production team got creative by&nbsp;using movie props and camera angles to&nbsp;hide her baby bump.</p><p><h2>11. Scarlett Johansson in&nbsp;<i>Avengers: Age of&nbsp;Ultron</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e84/1e6/745e24518eb51a8a04380f626f.jpg><p><a href=# title="Scarlett Johansson" data-link=tag>Scarlett Johansson</a> surely rocked the black bodysuit Black Widow wore in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Avengers: Age of&nbsp;Ultron,</i></a> but she was already expecting her daughter, Rose. That didn’t stop her from doing action sequences, and the crew went as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;to&nbsp;procure multiple <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>costumes</a>, hire stunt doubles, use close-ups, and experiment with visual effects.</p><p><h2>12. Isla Fisher in&nbsp;<i>Burke and Hare</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/976/faa/728ed25412b4aa24f52b7dac59.jpg><p>EAST NEWS<span>, </span>SNAPPER / bauergriffinonline.com / East News</p><p>Isla’s nineteenth-century costumes really worked in&nbsp;her favor while filming the black comedy, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Burke and Hare</i></a>. She was pregnant with her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>daughter</a>, Elula, at&nbsp;the time, but the crew and even her co-stars didn’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>notice</a>&nbsp;it. Instead, she used the film’s setting to&nbsp;her advantage and donned puffy dresses and oversized coats to&nbsp;hide her bump without squeezing into a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>corset</a>.</p><p><h2>13. Helena Bonham Carter in&nbsp;<i>Sweeney Todd</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/277/d42/0fa04f5d2cb26cc0a52573a576.jpg><p>It&nbsp;was during the final scenes of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Sweeney Todd</i></a> that <a href=# title="Helena Bonham Carter" data-link=tag>Helena Bonham Carter</a> discovered she was pregnant with her and director <a href=# title="Tim Burton" data-link=tag>Tim Burton</a>’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>daughter</a>, Nell. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, Burton decided to&nbsp;play along with the pregnancy by&nbsp;letting the actress wear darker dresses and adjusting the lights in&nbsp;some sequences to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>disguise</a> Mrs. Lovett’s seemingly growing tummy.</p><p><h2>14. Melissa Fumero in&nbsp;<i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/056/4c1/f33849549c8ed10b05f1a72707.jpg><p>Melissa’s baby Enzo couldn’t seem to&nbsp;wait to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>come</a> into the world while the actress was in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;shooting the third season of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i></a>. But instead of&nbsp;writing her pregnancy into the story, the show’s creators thought it&nbsp;was too soon for Detective Amy to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;child and came up&nbsp;with creative ways as&nbsp;the actress had started to&nbsp;show.</p><p>Detective Amy’s plotline involved a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;baggy clothes in&nbsp;the process. The writers even went with an&nbsp;undercover <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pregnant</a> lady storyline to&nbsp;give Melissa the comfort she needed without hiding her belly.</p><p><h2>15. Julie Bowen in&nbsp;<i>Modern Family</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/434/8a2/333ac557129b7a6e24c2ee1165.jpg><p>Julie Bowen was just a&nbsp;half-month shy of&nbsp;giving birth to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>twins</a> Gus and John when she started taping the pilot episode of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Modern Family</i></a>. Her character, Claire, wore many <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sweaters,</a> and the production team decided to&nbsp;use random things like laundry baskets, pillows, and even cereal boxes to&nbsp;cover her bump.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think was the cleverest way to&nbsp;hide a&nbsp;baby bump?
