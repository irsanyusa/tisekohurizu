You notice the escalator stopped moving, so&nbsp;it’s probably broken. You can choose to&nbsp;walk on&nbsp;it&nbsp;anyway or&nbsp;look for the stairs or&nbsp;an&nbsp;elevator. So, what it’s going to&nbsp;be?</p><p>If&nbsp;you chose option&nbsp;A and bravely stepped on&nbsp;a&nbsp;stopped escalator, I&nbsp;have some bad news for you. You’re putting yourself at&nbsp;risk since the escalator isn’t designed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;used as&nbsp;regular stairs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/720/14f/abcbb15993a6c3128b0f11d460.png><p>In&nbsp;case the escalator had stopped because of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mechanical failure, let’s say the brakes suddenly stopped functioning, it&nbsp;could roll away under load at&nbsp;any time. You never know when it&nbsp;starts moving again, so&nbsp;you might fall. The rise of&nbsp;the steps is&nbsp;normally higher on&nbsp;escalators than on&nbsp;regular staircases, so&nbsp;depending on&nbsp;where the moving stairs stop, some of&nbsp;them won’t be&nbsp;even. You might trip on&nbsp;them easily, especially when walking down.</p><p>Plus, escalators are designed to&nbsp;carry only a&nbsp;certain load at&nbsp;the same time. When people are moving like on&nbsp;a&nbsp;conveyor belt, there’s never too much weight at&nbsp;one moment. When the conveyor belt is&nbsp;stopped, the weight can go&nbsp;beyond the limit, and the escalator might collapse. If&nbsp;you still choose to&nbsp;walk on&nbsp;a&nbsp;non-working escalator, be&nbsp;prepared to&nbsp;experience something known as&nbsp;the “broken escalator phenomenon.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f71/ecc/8de2705fd0b8c5a2706ed45ccf.png><p>Whenever you ride or&nbsp;walk on&nbsp;a&nbsp;properly functioning escalator, your <a href=# title=brain data-link=tag>brain</a> marks it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;moving object. It&nbsp;fine-tunes the motor control of&nbsp;your legs and the balance mechanisms of&nbsp;your inner ear to&nbsp;adjust to&nbsp;this motion. Even when you see the escalator is&nbsp;obviously still, your unconscious brain recognizes it&nbsp;as&nbsp;the moving stairs. So&nbsp;once you’re walking up&nbsp;or&nbsp;down a&nbsp;stopped escalator, it&nbsp;feels weird and unnatural that it’s not moving.</p><p>In&nbsp;2015, London Underground carried out research to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;it’s more efficient to&nbsp;stand or&nbsp;walk on&nbsp;a&nbsp;moving escalator. It&nbsp;turned out that standing-only escalators at&nbsp;Holborn station could carry up&nbsp;to&nbsp;30% more people [16,220 compared to&nbsp;12,745] during rush hours than escalators that allow walkers. On&nbsp;taller escalators, most people tend to&nbsp;stand rather than walk, leaving unused room on&nbsp;the left side.</p><p>When all these spaces were filled, the waiting time to&nbsp;get on&nbsp;the moving stairs dropped sharply. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, the station only got overcrowded once compared to&nbsp;the regular several times a&nbsp;week. The Underground took note of&nbsp;these results but didn’t ban walking on&nbsp;escalators altogether since many people still wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1af/509/751a8f5ad2826e02774352a077.png><p>Have you ever tried cleaning your shoes against those brushes you can see on&nbsp;any escalator? Well, they’re actually there for safety. These brushes are also called skirt deflectors. The skirt is&nbsp;the gap between the stairs and the side. The brushes keep your shoes, feet, and loose clothing away from the gap.</p><p>When you get on&nbsp;an&nbsp;escalator, you’re mostly focused on&nbsp;keeping balance and hardly pay attention to&nbsp;little details. You won’t notice the gap when everything is&nbsp;fine, but if&nbsp;the escalator goes out of&nbsp;order, it&nbsp;can give you a&nbsp;hard time. The gap leads down into the mechanism that makes the escalator move. If&nbsp;something like a&nbsp;bag or&nbsp;a&nbsp;jacket or&nbsp;even your toes get stuck there, it&nbsp;can interrupt the motors’ work and cause an&nbsp;accident. Escalator brushes are there to&nbsp;stop foreign objects from getting inside the gap or&nbsp;deflecting them.</p><p>Some escalators also have a&nbsp;yellow border to&nbsp;indicate danger and remind passengers not to&nbsp;stay too close to&nbsp;the edges. New Delhi metro has an&nbsp;extra safety feature inspired by&nbsp;the traditional draped outfit. Sarees can easily get stuck on&nbsp;the corners of&nbsp;moving stairs. To&nbsp;prevent that from happening, they added saree guards on&nbsp;both sides of&nbsp;the escalators.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/293/661/74d91950b684c136a9df98cafb.png><p>The concept of&nbsp;escalators is&nbsp;much older than you could possibly imagine. Their ancestors were used for the construction of&nbsp;the Great Pyramid at&nbsp;Giza in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Egypt data-link=tag>Egypt</a>. They put over 2&nbsp;million stone cubes on&nbsp;tree trunks to&nbsp;roll them upwards on&nbsp;artificial earth bridges around the construction site. The idea of&nbsp;constantly rolling wheels under the transported rocks became one of&nbsp;the basic principles for future escalators. Like with many inventions, several people are credited for having invented the moving staircase as&nbsp;we&nbsp;know it&nbsp;today.</p><p>American inventor and engineer Jesse Reno was one of&nbsp;them. He&nbsp;patented his invention in&nbsp;1892. It&nbsp;was known as&nbsp;the “incline elevator” and was installed at&nbsp;the Old Iron Pier at&nbsp;Coney Island in&nbsp;New York City. It&nbsp;was extremely popular, and 75,000 people are reported to&nbsp;have tried out the invention during the 2&nbsp;weeks that it&nbsp;was showcased. The steam-powered conveyor belt was moving at&nbsp;a&nbsp;25°&nbsp;angle and traveled to&nbsp;a&nbsp;height of&nbsp;7&nbsp;feet. It&nbsp;was metal with a&nbsp;serrated surface, much like the escalators we&nbsp;know and love today.</p><p>There were comb-like teeth at&nbsp;the top and bottom landings to&nbsp;make the transition smooth. There was also a&nbsp;handrail for passenger safety. Already back then, Reno suggested that one escalator should take passengers up&nbsp;and another one&nbsp;— down. His invention was a&nbsp;success, and it&nbsp;was installed at&nbsp;various locations by&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the 20th century. It&nbsp;was later purchased by&nbsp;the Otis Elevator Company.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/2d1/98b/08bacf5781b0f3d8c069b8870e.png><p>Escalators have transformed shopping&nbsp;— thanks to&nbsp;them, the stores were able to&nbsp;grow to&nbsp;many levels. But the first escalator, which was installed at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the 19th century at&nbsp;London’s Harrods store, scared many customers. It&nbsp;was the first moving staircase in&nbsp;England, and the people had no&nbsp;idea if&nbsp;it&nbsp;was safe to&nbsp;use. Some of&nbsp;them believed it&nbsp;could mess up&nbsp;their internal organs.</p><p>To&nbsp;calm them down somehow, the store staff offered terrified shoppers drinks at&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;the escalator, which was only moving&nbsp;up. The longest outdoor escalator system in&nbsp;the world is&nbsp;Central Mid-level Escalator in&nbsp;Hong Kong. It&nbsp;runs for around half a&nbsp;mile. The idea behind this engineering gem was to&nbsp;ease the traffic situation in&nbsp;this busy city district.</p><p>They built 20&nbsp;escalators and three inclined moving walkways at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the 20th century. The system changes its direction to&nbsp;meet the needs of&nbsp;the commuters and runs downhill in&nbsp;the morning and uphill from 10:30&nbsp;am till midnight. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;now popular not only with the local residents but also with tourists who use it&nbsp;to&nbsp;get through the historical district up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the dining and nightlife hub.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f61/850/6d6362592686c55d65a26e0f6a.png><p>The escalator in&nbsp;the basement of&nbsp;More’s Department Store in&nbsp;Kawasaki, Japan, has made it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the Guinness Book of&nbsp;World Records as&nbsp;the shortest in&nbsp;the world. The “Puchicalator,” as&nbsp;it’s called, only has 5&nbsp;steps and takes its passengers 2.7 feet down to&nbsp;another landing, from where they continue the descent manually. There are regular stairs separated by&nbsp;a&nbsp;guard rail from the escalator, and they’re a&nbsp;faster option for those in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hurry. No&nbsp;one knows the reason why the escalator had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;installed here. It&nbsp;was probably to&nbsp;set a&nbsp;world record and attract more customers to&nbsp;the store.</p><p>All escalators are custom-made, depending on&nbsp;where they will be&nbsp;installed. There are some basic settings and mechanisms, of&nbsp;course, but the height, width, angle of&nbsp;incline, and speed are varied to&nbsp;fit the customer’s requirements. Some escalators even have a&nbsp;“Royal Mode” since they are designed for royalty. These models come with a&nbsp;button that allows the passengers to&nbsp;start and stop the moving staircase whenever they want.</p><p>There are also models with cooling units for hotter regions, so&nbsp;the passengers can safely touch the handrails&nbsp;— you wouldn’t want to&nbsp;hold on&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;frying pan, would you? Mobile escalators which travel on&nbsp;board airplanes can be&nbsp;used for boarding and disembarking passengers. There are also escalators high in&nbsp;the Alps, fitted with anti-slip treads for skiers, and stairs moving underwater through transparent tunnels at&nbsp;aquariums around the world.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLumwsSrZK6rlWKubr%2FTqKepnZRisrSvwKWYraeiYq60ecBmqq2ZmafEosWMoZyrnaNixKnFjHFobHFlanw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-randall-park-make-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Money Does Randall Park Make?
