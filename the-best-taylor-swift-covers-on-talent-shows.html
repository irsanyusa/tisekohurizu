Daniel Duke, The Voice UK 2015</h3><p>Incorporating his distinct acoustic-folk style to Swift’s “Shake It Off,” Daniel Duke proved that he was deserving to be a part of Team Tom. His rendition was chill yet energizing, a good way to hype up the audience.

Victoria Stoichkova, The Voice Bulgaria 2018</h3><p>“Look What You Made Me Do” is already an eerie song, but Victoria Stoichkova has convinced The Voice Bulgaria fans that it could be more bizarre.

Alex & Sierra, The X Factor USA 2013</h3><p>Overwhelmed by the disconcerting comments of the judges, Sierra needed to make sure that her next performance with Alex would be impeccable.
