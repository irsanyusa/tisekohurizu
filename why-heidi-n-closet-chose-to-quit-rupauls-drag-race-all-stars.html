The queen had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">previously contemplated quitting</a> earlier in the season.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-heidi-n-closet-quits-rupaul-s-drag-race-all-stars>Heidi N Closet Quits RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars</h2><p>Heidi is known for competing on Season 12 of RuPaul’s Drag Race, where she won the Miss Congeniality award and finished the competition in sixth place. She returned to compete on Season 8 of All Stars, which recently aired its fifth episode.</p><p>While getting ready for judging in the Werk Room, Heidi became <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the center of drama</a> with her fellow queens. First Kahanna accused Heidi of “throwing the jokes back at me” and “antagonizing me” during the celebrity impersonation challenge.</p><p>After that, Kandy Muse asked Heidi, “Why did I hear that you went to Jimbo and told her that I’m coming for her?” Heidi responded that she and Alexis Michelle heard Kandy say that. Alexis seemed to agree at first, before seeming to walk it back.</p><p>Heidi got emotional as she informed her competitors that she would be leaving the show, explaining that “this has become really ugly and really hideous, and I don’t like that.” She walked out of the Werk Room in tears. Kandy tried to convince her to stay, but Heidi said she wouldn’t regret her decision.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HEIDI N CLOSET REVEALS WHY SHE STAYED ON ‘DRAG RACE ALL STARS’ AFTER THREATENING TO LEAVE</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-heidi-spoke-out-after-leaving-the-show>Heidi Spoke Out After Leaving the Show</h2><p>“It’s been such an incredible experience,” Heidi told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a>. “I’ve been riddled with anxiety and struggling with bouts of depression. You never know. The waiting, you just don’t know how it’ll look and come off to the masses. I’d say 95 percent has been positive energy. I’m grateful that people see me and my talents, and that I did what was best for me in the heat of the moment.”</p><p>Heidi went on to tell the outlet that Kandy told her and Alexis of Jimbo, “The producers love her. If her ass ever lands in the bottom, we’ll all send her home.” She also said of Alexis crying after she left, “A master class in acting! Give her an Emmy…. B*tch, I live. I live for it. Girl, on cue!”</p><p>She said she has “zero regrets,” adding that she hopes her decision sends the message, “Don’t stay somewhere. If you’re not happy somewhere, change that.” Heidi also didn’t rule out returning to Drag Race at some point in the future.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Original_ScottyMcCreery_Dave-PedleyGetty-Images-for-iHeartRadio-220x147.jpg alt="Scotty McCreery Talks About Snubbing Jack Black on ‘American Idol’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>rupaul's drag race</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>rupaul's drag race all stars</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGwZqCVnrGqec1mmqWno5rBbq%2FHqKqeZaSkerLByK1kq62glsKtv4ydqZqfXaeupLGMmqOlZaOprrO%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./une-tribune-libre-nest-pas-un-don-mais-elle-un-cout.html><span>←</span><span>Une tribune libre n'est pas un don, mais elle a un cot</span></a>
