The auction, which was intended to earn as much as $16 million to help fill Pakistan’s coffers, netted just $600,000 on Monday, the BBC reports.
More than 100 used cars were on the auction block at the government’s heavily-publicized fire sale."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

But many of the vehicles were far from ritzy, and some had been purchased as far back as the 1980s.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Only 62 vehicles found buyers, the most expensive of them a bulletproof 2015 Toyota Land Cruiser that was sold for $200,000. Four bulletproof 2005 Mercedes jeeps were also purchased, but more than a dozen other Mercedes and seven BMWs remained unsold.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The auction’s top-billing items, a pair of Mercedes Maybach S-600s acquired in 2016 under former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, were also snubbed. The cars, which were being sold for $1.3 million each, were greeted with laughter but no bids, the BBC reports.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=#>Imran Khan Is Riding a Populist Wave in Pakistan</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The auction wasn’t Pakistan’s first, according to the BBC, but it was promoted by Prime Minister Imran Khan’s administration as an austerity measure. Khan, a former cricket star, was <a href=#>elected in July</a> on a populist anti-corruption platform, but critics say his economic approach has been more about rhetoric than policy. Khan also drew criticism last month when it was revealed that he <a href=# rel=noopener>commutes by helicopter</a> to avoid Islamabad’s notorious traffic.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But that mattered little to Afzal, a buyer from Rawalpindi who left the auction with one of the day’s biggest bargains: a 2005 Suzuki hatchback that cost just $4,000. “After all, the money will return to our national exchequer and this is what our prime minister wants,” he told BBC Urdu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZua2lufnh8jqmYpKGjqa6vecimqZqmXaC1orqMmqycrJmku27CxKGgnKSVqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./les-maires-des-grandes-villes-veulent-avoir-leur-mot-dire-sur-la-reforme-hospitaliere.html><span>←</span><span>Les maires des grandes villes veulent avoir leur mot dire sur la rforme hospitalire</span></a>
