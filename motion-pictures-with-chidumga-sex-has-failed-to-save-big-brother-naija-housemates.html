While Soma and Miyonse kept viewers entertained with their sexual activities with fellow housemates <strong>Gifty </strong>and <strong>TBoss, </strong>Efe was simply an active housemate who had won hearts with his dramatic entrance on the show's opening night.</p><p>On Sunday, February 12, 2017, Nigerians saved <strong>Debbie-Rise </strong>(a talented housemate who is more focused on her music than on being dramatic)instead of <strong>CocoIce </strong>who had bared her breast on Live Television while her fellow housemate <strong>Bassey </strong>feasted on it.</p><p>CocoIce was up for eviction alongside the dramatic Bisola and Gifty, and the boring Bassey and Debbie-Rise.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Anyone would have expected CocoIce's breasts to save her, afterall, she had shown Nigerians her willingness to do anything on the show.</p><p>Defenders of the sexual content on Big Brother Naija claim it is a form of entertainment. But, when it comes&nbsp; to the weekly voting, the results so far have proven that the viewers are not influenced by that kind of 'entertainment.'</p><p>A week after Soma and Miyonse's eviction, BBNaija didn't trend on social media. Nobody was kissing, cuddling, breaking up or engaging in foreplay. The remaining housemates were more of people who were reserved and not bold enough to make such explicit moves, thus the boring social media moments during the week.</p><p>The show only comes alive during Saturday house parties, when housemates get drunk, bare their boobs, cuddle up and participate in kissing festivals.</p><p>Without its sexual content, Big Brother Naija doesn't trend on social media. However, while Nigerians relish those explicit moments, it hasn't been the salvation of any housemate so far on the show.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Following the eviction of&nbsp;Soma, Miyonse&nbsp;and&nbsp;Cocoice<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>Biggie decided to introduce two fake housemates, <strong>Ese </strong>and <strong>Jon,</strong> to <strong>galvanize </strong>the game in&nbsp;Big Brother Naijahouse.</p><p><strong>Gifty, </strong>who has been 'entertaining' is currently up for eviction, viewers would have to wait until Sunday to find out if her accent, kissing spree, and relationships will save her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mpq%2Bhlah8rrvToqanZaCesLXB0Z6qZq%2BZqbVur8eim66ll5Z6tLHXZp%2Baq12brqq4xJ1kraddqK63sYyboKBlkqe8tbTEq2SnmZmfrm60zq6qnqWRqbK0e5JsqnKyaaU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./humanities-and-social-sciences.html><span>←</span><span>Religious studies &amp;amp; Theology - Czech Universities</span></a>
