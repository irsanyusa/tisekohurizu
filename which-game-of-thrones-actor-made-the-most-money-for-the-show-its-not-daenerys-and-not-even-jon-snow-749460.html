The finale was really divisive and controversial, and you probably know that some fans were actually so&nbsp;unsatisfied with season 8&nbsp;that they created a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>petition</a> to&nbsp;reshoot the final season and the author of&nbsp;the books, George Martin, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>promised</a> that the end of&nbsp;the book saga would be&nbsp;different from the show. But one thing we&nbsp;can still talk about are the financials of&nbsp;the show.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> wondered how much money the actors earned during their work on&nbsp;Game of&nbsp;Thrones and who earned the most after the partnership with the HBO channel. And at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the article, there is&nbsp;an&nbsp;interesting bonus for you.</p><p><h2>15. Nathalie Emmanuel (Missandei)&nbsp;— $1&nbsp;million</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c55/604/9d83b05b8aa31e9d913f343b95.jpg><p>Nathalie Emmanuel’s character, Missandei, made her first appearance in&nbsp;season 3&nbsp;and almost instantly earned love from some adoring fans. Over the course of&nbsp;5&nbsp;seasons, she evolved from a&nbsp;slave into Daenerys’s right hand. From what we&nbsp;know, Nathalie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>earned</a> $100,000 per episode. This is&nbsp;very good money for an&nbsp;actress who is&nbsp;not playing a&nbsp;main role.</p><p><h2>14. Alfie Allen (Theon Greyjoy)&nbsp;— $100,000 per episode</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e8b/016/c8a94155f18dbac5129f5a5adf.jpg><p>Theon Greyjoy’s character has been on&nbsp;the show since the first season. During season&nbsp;8, he&nbsp;changed a&nbsp;lot and moved from a&nbsp;category&nbsp;C actor to&nbsp;a&nbsp;category&nbsp;B actor. In&nbsp;the final season, actor Alfie Allen <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>received</a> about $100,000 per episode.</p><p><h2>13. Conleth Hill (Varys)&nbsp;— $100,000 per episode</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8c6/92f/cd18ee52e4b565efbe4546b13d.jpg><p>Varys is&nbsp;another character that has been a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the show since season 1. British actor Conleth Hill’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>earnings</a> were about $100,000 per episode in&nbsp;seasons 7-8. Conleth Hill earned around $2&nbsp;million for the entire show.</p><p><h2>12. Gwendoline Christie (Brienne of&nbsp;Tarth)&nbsp;— $100,000 per episode</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c6c/190/9bcfdd5195a6c29a225af33b0e.jpg><p>Brienne of&nbsp;Tarth, the first Lord Commander of&nbsp;the Kingsguard and the first Lady Knight appeared in&nbsp;season 2. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>According to&nbsp;Celebrity Net Worth</a>, English actress Gwendoline Christie who portrayed Brienne of&nbsp;Tarth used to&nbsp;make $100,000 per episode.</p><p><h2>11. Iain Glen (Jorah Mormont)&nbsp;— $100,000 per episode</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c2b/16c/27dfeb579fb60d8a38d68a64d9.jpg><p>Jorah Mormont, a&nbsp;knight who was banished from Westeros, appeared back in&nbsp;season 1. But he&nbsp;was always a&nbsp;supporting character. Scottish actor Iain Glen managed to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>earn</a> around $100,000 per episode for his role in&nbsp;the series.</p><p><h2>10. Isaac Hempstead Wright (Bran Stark)&nbsp;— $175,000 per episode</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b97/f63/488841521e84270cd67ff9f616.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Isaac</a> Hempstead Wright was only 10&nbsp;years old when he&nbsp;joined the show as&nbsp;Bran Stark. Now, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;23&nbsp;years old, and <i>Game of&nbsp;Thrones</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>brought</a> him around $175,000 per episode.</p><p><h2>9. Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark)&nbsp;— $175,000&nbsp;— $210,000 per episode</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a51/14b/1bd0e25ccd97eca9486a80d6ed.jpg><p>Sansa Stark is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the key characters of&nbsp;the show and a&nbsp;fan-favorite. Not very long ago, actress <a href=# title="Sophie Turner" data-link=tag>Sophie Turner</a> <a href=#>earned</a> $175 thousand per episode, but in&nbsp;the final season, her earnings <a href=#>increased</a> to&nbsp;about $210 thousand per episode. Turner recently <a href=#>told</a> Harper’s Bazaar that her earnings were way lower than Kit Harrington’s, but she was totally okay with that since he&nbsp;had way more screen time and a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;nighttime work.</p><p><h2>8. Maisie Williams (Arya Stark)&nbsp;— $150,000&nbsp;— $210,000 per episode</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fac/b5e/000aa35bdf8e67226d83c2767c.jpg><p>Maisie Williams also came to&nbsp;the set as&nbsp;a&nbsp;teenager. For 8&nbsp;seasons, her earnings <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>grew</a> from $150,000 per episode to&nbsp;$210,000 per episode. In&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>this interview</a>, Maisie said that in&nbsp;the very beginning of&nbsp;<i>Game of&nbsp;Thrones</i>, all she wanted from the show was to&nbsp;make enough money for a&nbsp;new laptop.</p><p><h2>7. Natalie Dormer (Margaery Tyrell)&nbsp;— $100,000 per episode</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/315/fc0/8017fd587ebc025fc960691ab1.jpg><p>Margaery Tyrell was a&nbsp;supporting character on&nbsp;the show, but this didn’t stop her from becoming a&nbsp;fan-favorite and earning a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money. She appeared in&nbsp;season 2&nbsp;and she was one of&nbsp;the most interesting characters until she died in&nbsp;season 6. Natalie Dormer was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>making</a> $100,000 per episode.</p><p><h2>6. Rory McCann (Sandor Clegane)&nbsp;— $100,000 per episode</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/af6/b1a/7b8d6b5169867a1c93617d75f8.jpg><p>Sandor Clegane, also known as&nbsp;The Hound, appeared in&nbsp;season 1. The character went through a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;changes and by&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the show, he&nbsp;was more or&nbsp;less a&nbsp;positive character. The show <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>earned</a> Scottish actor Rory McCann around $100,000 per episode.</p><p><h2>5. Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister)&nbsp;— $500,000 per episode</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/89d/27c/ee79c4550bb4272bbd7db4d69a.jpg><p>Lena Headey is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the top 5&nbsp;main Game of&nbsp;Thrones characters and she is&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>A-list</a> actress. Her character Cersei Lannister is&nbsp;probably the main villain of&nbsp;the show. According to&nbsp;some <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sources</a>, the actress used to&nbsp;make $500,000 per episode.</p><p><h2>4. Kit Harington (Jon Snow)&nbsp;— $500,000 per episode</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/37e/768/dea5a25fcdb891cae35169749c.jpg><p>Jon Snow became one of&nbsp;the main characters of&nbsp;the show and he&nbsp;has millions of&nbsp;fans. But it&nbsp;hasn’t always been like that. Before 2013, Kit Harrington’s character was not the most popular and the actor didn’t start making <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>good money</a> until season 5&nbsp;— which was about $500,000 per episode.</p><p><h2>3. Emilia Clarke (Daenerys Targaryen)&nbsp;— $500,000 per episode</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/77f/350/c575ab552c9dae9b8f831477c0.jpg><p>Daenerys Targaryen, Khaleesi, the Mother of&nbsp;Dragons and Breaker of&nbsp;Chains, is&nbsp;the central character of&nbsp;<i>Game of&nbsp;Thrones</i>. We&nbsp;could say that Emilia Clarke’s career started with this show. Just like Kit Harrington, the actress was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>receiving</a> $500,000 per episode. In&nbsp;the final season, Clarke received <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>more</a> than $1&nbsp;million per episode, just like all of&nbsp;the other key actors. Last year, Emilia Clarke <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>told</a> <i>Vanity Fair </i>that she was paid as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;her friends.</p><p><h2>2. Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister)&nbsp;— $500,000 per episode</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fac/b4f/01f2e75cef8a3bb5ba4feeb8c6.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Peter Dinklage</a> who portrayed Tyrion Lannister was quite a&nbsp;popular actor even before <i>Game of&nbsp;Thrones</i> started. He&nbsp;would make $500,000 per episode like the other big stars of&nbsp;the show. And then during the last season, his salary rose to&nbsp;$1.2 million per episode.</p><p><h2>1. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister)&nbsp;— $720,000 per episode</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a8f/636/8167d2525aba1ebc8a80d7c16c.jpg><p>Jaime Lannister is&nbsp;another key character that fans have loved since season 1. The earnings of&nbsp;Danish actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau in&nbsp;this role grew several times and by&nbsp;the final season, he&nbsp;<a href=#>was</a> making $1.2 million per episode. Coster-Waldau is&nbsp;considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the <a href=#>richest</a> actors in&nbsp;Game of&nbsp;Thrones.</p><p><h2>Bonus</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3b6/5f4/a028015f2abe2dfb7f8d59f239.jpg><p>Even though Sean Bean’s character Ned Stark was killed in&nbsp;the very first season of&nbsp;Game of&nbsp;Thrones, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the richest actors on&nbsp;the show. Today, Sean Bean <a href=#>has</a> a&nbsp;net worth of&nbsp;$20&nbsp;million. We&nbsp;don’t know how much money he&nbsp;received for the season, but the thing is&nbsp;the actor was quite popular before the show even started. For example, he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;part in&nbsp;The Lord of&nbsp;the Rings. Also, the role of&nbsp;Ned Stark made him even more popular and Sean Bean <a href=# title=got data-link=tag>got</a> many other offers afterward. After Game of&nbsp;Thrones, he&nbsp;did big projects like Medici: Masters of&nbsp;Florence and The Oath.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, the show earned a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money not only for the actors but also for everyone who worked on&nbsp;it. For example, the HBO channel <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>earned</a> $3.1 billion just from user subscriptions, and book author <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>George Martin</a> earned about $65&nbsp;million.</p><p>Who is&nbsp;your favorite Game of&nbsp;Thrones character?</p><p><b>Please note</b>: This article was updated in August 2022 to correct source material and factual inaccuracies.</p><p>Preview photo credit ANGELA WEISS/AFP / East News<span>, </span>ANGELA WEISS/AFP / East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSptcKhZKCZnZp6sLKMrZ%2Brp56awG6twq2mq2WdlrGmedOhnGaln6jBbrnOp5yyZZakv27Ax55krKCfrHqqwNJmpaisXZmuprrEq7CsZZGjsW66zq1knq6Vo3qru81mqqenp2KEdYWTb2do</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./velvet-goldmine-velvet-mines-glam-rock-era-1200453527.html><span>←</span><span>Velvet Goldmine Velvet Mines Glam Rock Era</span></a>
