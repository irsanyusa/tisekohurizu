An essentially equal share of white adults (77%) said the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Mamie Voight, president and chief executive of the Institute for Higher Education Policy, noted that the high cost of attendance threatens to leave behind students of color and students from low-income backgrounds, “the ones most likely to be negatively impacted” by soaring prices.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">To that end, the Institute for Higher Education Policy supports efforts to double the maximum Pell Grant award to help students defray the cost of attending college.

The piled-up costs often become insurmountable for the students “who have the most to gain from higher education,” Voight said, leading to the accrual of debt without anything to show for it.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“Among the 39 million people across the country with some college but no degree, many carry debt without the higher earnings a degree should bring,” Voight said, “which is precisely the opposite of the social and economic mobility that postsecondary education should provide.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZMGzsc2dZKydpKmys7%2BOnKalpJWcsm6txZ%2Bmq5yRl7attdOyZKyspZmyr8CMpaaapqNiwLa%2B1Z6wZpyRqa4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./conflits-dinterets-la-commission-sauve-prone-une-loi-et-met-laccent-sur-la-prevention.html><span>←</span><span>la commission Sauv prne une loi et met l'accent sur la prvention</span></a>
