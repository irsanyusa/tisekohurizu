But the Potter train certainly didn’t stop there. In the time since her series’ epic 2007 conclusion, J.K. Rowling has kept fans enthralled with a <a href=# rel=noopener>stream of new information</a> about the lives of her characters in the post-He Who Shall Not Be Named wizarding world.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here are 10 major Rowling revelations about what Harry, Ron, Hermione and the rest of the magical gang have been up to over the past two decades.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Love was in the air:</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Not only did Harry and Ron marry Ginny and Hermione, respectively, but Luna Lovegood and Rolf Scamander, Neville Longbottom and Hannah Abbott, Draco Malfoy and Astoria Greengrass, and George Weasley and Angelina Johnson also all tied the knot. Harry and Ginny went on to have three kids — James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna — while Ron and Hermione popped out two of their own — Rose and Hugo.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Golden Trio took over the Ministry:</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Following Kingsley Shacklebolt’s appointment as permanent Minister for Magic, he chose Harry to be head of the Auror department. Ron became an Auror as well, while Hermione worked her way up in the Deptartment of Magical Law Enforcement.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Harry and Ron utterly revolutionized the Auror Department at the Ministry of Magic. They are now the experts. It doesn’t matter how old they are or what else they’ve done,” Rowling told <a href=# rel=noopener>TODAY</a>, adding that Hermione’s “brainpower and her knowledge of how the Dark Arts operate would really give her a sound grounding.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Hermione finished school, of course:</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Although Harry and Ron never returned to Hogwarts to finish their seventh year, Hermione put in the effort to get her N.E.W.T.s.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“She would definitely, definitely go back, and she would want to graduate,” Rowling explained during an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>PotterCast</a>. “She went with Ron and Harry because she has a really good heart. That’s not about brain. Ultimately, she had a bigger heart than she had a brain, and that’s saying something for Hermione. But was she naturally drawn to battle? No, she wasn’t…She would be glad to go back to school, be glad to get back to study, and then would join them at the Ministry.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Ginny stuck with Quidditch:</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After playing professionally with the Holyhead Harpies, Ginny became the Senior Quidditch correspondent at<i> The Daily Prophet.</i></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Neville landed a post at Hogwarts:</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Inspired by his love of plants and fungi, Neville became the new herbology professor at his alma mater. However, he first served a short stint as an Auror alongside Harry and Ron, helping to clean up any remaining corruption in the aftermath of the war.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">But his parents never recovered:</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to Rowling, Alice and Frank Longbottom were eventually moved to the incurable wing of St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries to continue treatment for their torture-induced insanity.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I know people really wanted some hope for that, and I can quite see why because, in a way, what happens to Neville’s parents is even worse than what happened to Harry’s parents,” <a href=# rel=noopener>she said</a>. “The damage that is done, in some cases with very dark magic, is done permanently.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Harry and Dudley maintained a relationship:</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The once-estranged cousins made amends after Dudley’s admission that Harry wasn’t a “waste of space” and remained on “Christmas-card terms” as they grew older. However, their relationship never blossomed into a true friendship. “They would visit more out of a sense of duty and sit in silence so that their children could see their cousins,” Rowling told fans during a <a href=# rel=noopener>2007 Q&A</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Teddy Lupin was loved by all:</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The orphaned Teddy was raised by his grandmother Andromeda, but had several surrogate parents, including his godfather Harry. He went on to date Victoire Weasley — the eldest daughter of Bill and Fleur — who he was <a href=# rel=noopener>caught snogging</a> in The Deathly Hollows epilogue.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Snape was remembered as headmaster:</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Despite the conspicuous absence of Snape’s portrait during Harry’s final visit to Hogwarts’ headmasters office in The Deathly Hallows, Rowling has explained that Harry would make sure his sacrifice was not forgotten.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Snape had effectively abandoned his post before dying, so he had not merited inclusion in these august circles,” she said during a <a href=# rel=noopener>web chat</a>. “However, I like to think that Harry would be instrumental in ensuring that Snape’s portrait would appear there in due course…Harry would ensure that Snape’s heroism was known.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The trio went down in Chocolate Frog card history:</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Harry, Ron and Hermione were all immortalized on Chocolate Frog cards — an accomplishment that Ron, of course, described as “<a href=# rel=noopener>his finest hour</a>.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtb2Rug3aAjqGYq6qpYr2wwNOeqWZpaWLGpq3RZqOarJWneqO7zqRm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michelle-keegan-ten-pound-poms-season-2-1235893174.html><span>←</span><span>Fool Me Once Star Michelle Keegan Returns for Second Season of Ten Pound Poms</span></a>
