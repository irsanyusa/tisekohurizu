He said a part of him in Nollywood would always remain alive forever, and he could always build a film school, or become an executive producer.</p><p>The 55-year-old said the only thing that could ever lure him to return to the front of the camera as an actor is "if Nigeria becomes better than America."</p><p>He said, "The possibility is there because we have all it takes — men, materials, money. One thing that's lacking is the power to combine, utilise and allocate these resources optimally to produce the desired goods and services that will make us achieve our objectives."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Okonkwo made his name as an actor playing Andy Okeke, the lead character in the 1992 Nollywood classic, Living in Bondage, and reprised his role in the film's 2019 sequel, <a href=# id=bbfde078-add2-4768-822d-6ea6a170a7a4 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab><strong>Living in Bondage: Breaking Free</strong></a>.
