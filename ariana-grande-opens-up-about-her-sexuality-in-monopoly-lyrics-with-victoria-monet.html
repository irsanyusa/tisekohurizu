Ariana sings, "I like women and men," convincing some fans she was coming out as bisexual. Mont, who <a href=# id=c3b65ec5-7b09-36a9-a2fc-35be8c565f76>came out as bisexual</a> last November, chimed in on Instagram by commenting on a post: "she said what she said." But that could mean pretty much anything, since yes, lyrics are lyrics, but that doesn't mean they're autobiographical.</p><p>Once the debate over Ariana's potential sexuality hit the Twitterverse (and hit it hard), Ari set the record straight in a reply to a fan's tweet, saying she hasn't ever labeled her sexuality and doesn't "feel the need to now which is okay." (RETWEET.)</p><p>i havent before and still dont feel the need to now which is okay - Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) <a href=# id=3e4e4a1c-1de6-3be8-a5f8-d03561f1f25a>April 1, 2019</a></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>She also liked a handful of tweets that put forth the message that <a href=# id=ca2f7479-9033-3657-aad4-55d7f0213812>sexuality is fluid</a> and exists on a spectrum.</p><p>i havent before and still dont feel the need to now which is okay - Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) <a href=# id=3e4e4a1c-1de6-3be8-a5f8-d03561f1f25a>April 1, 2019</a></p><p>The hoopla over "Monopoly" comes just over a month after Ariana <a href=# id=a898d2af-40e2-33ae-af92-8ebbb25efdfe>received backlash</a> for taking the headliner slot at Manchester Pride as an assumed straight person. "I want to celebrate and support this community, regardless of my identity or how people label me," she said in response to the controversy. The key phrase there is "how people label me," mmmkay? Since Ariana has now said she doesn't feel the need to label her sexuality, that label (or lack thereof) shouldn't matter to anyone else.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZMSwucSnqmaglZa5tbSOmqmimZ6Weqi%2BwKebnmWfpbKvv4yup2aZkqTCtXnHnqlmq5WtwqK4yK2wZqGeYrqwus6ppqWxXaHGs7XCrGSwoaSdere1wq2mq6GRYrqwusStZrJrpJ3Gcn4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1605426-air-peace-rano-air-airlines-choose-lucrative-routes-hike-charges-aircraft-shortages.html><span>←</span><span>Air Peace, Rano Air, Other Airlines Choose Lucrative Routes, Hike Fares over Aircraft Shortages</span></a>
