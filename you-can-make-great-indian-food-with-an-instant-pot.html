 Why the Instant Pot?   Because it's so easy. You know this if you've ever made chili in an Instant Potor tasted chili from one.

Dried Beans and Legumes</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>They're filling, calcium-rich, and loaded with antioxidants. Chickpeas, mung beans, kidney beans, red split lentils, and yellow split lentils are all good ones to start with for Instant Pot Indian cooking.</p><p>Masoor dal (red split lentils) are great, because they are also one of the easiest lentils to work with. They dont require any soaking prior to cooking and have a short cooking time even if you aren't using an Instant Pot.</p><p>While you use a wide variety of spices in Indian cooking, here are your basics: garam masala, turmeric, red chilli powder, cumin seeds, coriander powder, and mustard seeds. Other important spices include cardamom pods, cumin powder, and cloves.</p><p>You can buy most of these through your supermarket, South Asian grocer, or an online marketplace.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>3. Canned Tomatoes</strong></p><p>Specifically, diced tomatoes. They're convenient because you don't need to chop them and they'll last longer than fresh tomatoes. Diced, canned tomatoes are more useful than other varieties, such as stewed or crushed. You can liquify diced tomatoes, but you can't solidify crushed or stewed tomatoes.</p><p><strong>4. Minced Ginger and Garlic</strong></p><p>Minced ginger and garlic or ginger-and-garlic paste can be found at most grocery stores. However, South Asian grocers also have jars of minced ginger and garlic paste combined together. This means you don't have to do much legwork.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>5. Onions and Potatoes</strong></p><p>You usually use red onions in Indian cuisine, but this isnt the time to be picky so, really, most onions will do. Potatoes are also a common ingredient in Indian cuisine. They're cheap and filling substance and they last for at least a few weeks.</p><p>You will need rice for most Indian dishes. Specifically basmati rice. Basmati rice is different than other rice in that it's thinner and longer than most types of rice.You can get that at your local supermarket but if you really want to stock up, head to your local Asian store and pick up a giant bag of rice thatll last you for a while.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-24>What Are Some Good Indian Instant Pot Recipes to Start With?</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-aa38b726-dd14-465e-a746-e0ca1f825123 data-caption="Indian food Curry butter chicken, Palak Paneer, Chiken Tikka, Biryani, Papad, Dal, Rice with Saffron and Naan bread on white background"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/zSFktkuTURBXy83YzA4MGM5ZS1lZDZhLTRhNjItYTIzZi01MjdiNWI4MGNhYTUuanBlZ5GVAs0DFs0CD8LD></span><p>This blog has simple recipes that even one unfamiliar to Indian or South Asian cuisine can follow.
