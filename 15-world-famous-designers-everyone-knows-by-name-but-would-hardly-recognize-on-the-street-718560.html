He&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;with his brother and sister, and when he&nbsp;was only 7&nbsp;years old, his dad passed away. His mom got remarried and divorced a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;times, which meant his family had to&nbsp;move to&nbsp;a&nbsp;different place.</p><p>When he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;teenager, he&nbsp;moved to&nbsp;his grandmother’s in&nbsp;Manhattan, where she taught him how to&nbsp;knit. This inspired him to&nbsp;look into the fashion industry, and he&nbsp;eventually started becoming interested in&nbsp;fashion design. At&nbsp;15, he&nbsp;applied to&nbsp;the High School of&nbsp;Art and Design and worked at&nbsp;a&nbsp;clothing store. He&nbsp;met a&nbsp;fashion designer named Perry Ellis in&nbsp;that store, who became his mentor after some time. After he&nbsp;graduated high school, he&nbsp;went to&nbsp;Parsons School of&nbsp;Design, where he&nbsp;made many creations and earned high honors.</p><p>At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;23, with the support of&nbsp;sponsors, Jacobs <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>designed</a> his first collection with the label, Marc Jacobs. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;24, he&nbsp;was recognized as&nbsp;the youngest designer who had ever gotten a&nbsp;prestigious award from the Council of&nbsp;Fashion Designers of&nbsp;America.</p><p><h2>2. Christian Louboutin, age&nbsp;59</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/17b/be1/137a0352daa6e3d926339e503f.jpg><p>LAURENT BENHAMOU/SIPA/EAST NEWS</p><p>Christian Louboutin was born in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Paris data-link=tag>Paris</a> and has 3&nbsp;sisters. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, he&nbsp;stated that he&nbsp;had much darker skin than his family members, leading him to&nbsp;believe he&nbsp;was adopted. He&nbsp;found out that his father was Egyptian, and his mother had a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>secret</a> affair with his biological father. In&nbsp;school, he&nbsp;was expelled 3&nbsp;times and decided to&nbsp;run away when he&nbsp;was just 12&nbsp;years old. His mom allowed him to&nbsp;live at&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend’s house.</p><p>Since he&nbsp;was young, Louboutin had been creating women’s footwear for Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent, and Maud Frizon as&nbsp;a&nbsp;freelance designer. When it&nbsp;came to&nbsp;his career, he&nbsp;brought stilettos back into fashion in&nbsp;the ’90s and 2000s, making many styles with heels over 4.72&nbsp;inches. His aim was to&nbsp;make women feel elegant and beautiful and make their legs look as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;possible. However, Louboutin is&nbsp;widely known for the red leather soles in&nbsp;high heels, which were first made in&nbsp;1993. Even though his sketches didn’t perfectly match his ideas, he&nbsp;was satisfied with the famous results. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;27, he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;establish his own company and opened a&nbsp;store. Soon after that, he&nbsp;started to&nbsp;make shoes for royals and Hollywood celebrities, and his famous red soles became one of&nbsp;the most recognizable fashion trends in&nbsp;the world.</p><p><h2>3.

His biological parents split up&nbsp;when he&nbsp;was very young, and then he&nbsp;got a&nbsp;new name when he&nbsp;was 5&nbsp;years old. His mother moved on&nbsp;to&nbsp;marry a&nbsp;businessman named Bill Kors. He&nbsp;got to&nbsp;choose his own first name, with Michael being his first favorite and David being his second. His mom also let him design her wedding dress, which he&nbsp;was very happy about since he&nbsp;was so&nbsp;interested in&nbsp;fashion.</p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;teenager, Kors started to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>design</a> clothes and sell them from his parents’ basement.

When Kors was 23&nbsp;years old, he&nbsp;asked a&nbsp;fashion editor named Anna Wintour to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;his collection, and soon after that, he&nbsp;earned many awards for his designs.</p><p><h2>4.

At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;18, he&nbsp;opened up&nbsp;a&nbsp;place that sold hippie fits, which became very popular, and he&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;owning many stores. He&nbsp;then married one of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>employees</a> at&nbsp;his store, a&nbsp;woman named Susie Carona. Shortly after, they became designers, but he&nbsp;really only wanted to&nbsp;have his own personal label and become a&nbsp;famous designer.</p><p>At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;20, Hilfiger <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>opened</a> his own clothing store, but he&nbsp;went bankrupt after 5&nbsp;years.
