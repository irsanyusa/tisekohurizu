He’s known for winning the show twice. First in season 13 of AGT and again in season one of AGT: The Champions. Since winning the show twice, he has gone on to have an extremely successful career</strong>.<strong> He spent the Covid-19 lockdown stepping up his magic game.</strong></p><p>Shin has overcome plenty of struggles in his career, so it was no shock that he was able to make it through a pandemic where he couldn’t perform live. Instead of dreading every second of the lock down, he took the time to rework his act for his upcoming Las Vegas Residency.</p><p>“I’m obviously so grateful to be back and performing,” he said. “I think it feels so weird to not perform for one whole year so it’s great to be back and being able to do what I love.”</p><p>He described his show as not an entirely new show, but with the feeling of one. Shin also made sure to share that he will be taking his show to the next level once again.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><br><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shin-lim-teaches-his-wife-magic-during-pandemic>Shin Lim Teaches His Wife Magic During Pandemic</h2><p>During the lockdown, he also taught his wife Casey Thomas some new tricks. If you follow Shin or his wife on Instagram I’m sure you’ve seen her magic by now. Shin revealed to us that magic became Thomas’s quarantine hobby last spring.</p><p>“[Thomas] started picking up magic during quarantine. She was, I guess, bored and she wanted to learn,” Shin said. “She picked it up really fast. Way faster than I anticipated, she’s really good actually.”</p><p>Although he said she will not be taking to the stage with him in his Las Vegas residency, he did mention that she was a part of the show itself.</p><p>“She actually directs my show, she also put together all the scenic parts,” he said. “She helped develop [it], so she actually plays a pretty crucial role in the artistic side of the show.”</p><p>It was so cool to hear that his show at The Mirage Theatre in Las Vegas was created by both he and his wife. Shin will be performing in Las Vegas until December 31, and will also be returning to the <a href=#>AGT stage on August 25</a> as a guest performer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CDo32edHmT4/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-constant-star-of-agt>The Constant Star of AGT</h2><p>Shin first auditioned for America’s Got Talent season 13 after competing in F.I.S.M. World Championships of Magic twice, bringing his act to Penn and Teller’s Fool Us, and almost losing his entire career due to a thumb injury.</p><p>His amazing audition featured his chest tattoo of the Queen of Spades. He said that he got this tattoo when he was 18 years-old and was “saving it for that one moment.”</p><p>That one moment, was the moment almost everyone knew he was going to win the talent show. From there, he went on to win season 13 of America’s Got Talent, then return to the stage for AGT: The Champions, which he also won.</p><p>Since his two wins he’s made sure to stay active on <a href=#>social media</a>, where he posts magic with his wife. He married Thomas in 2019, and skyrocketed to fame as one of the world’s best slight-of-hand magicians.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Simon-Cowell-AGT-Americas-Got-Talent-Simon-Cowell-rude-comments-Michael-Winslow-Keith-Apicary-e1629953560987.jpeg alt="Simon Cowell Lashes Out at ‘AGT’ Acts for Underwhelming Live Performances" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qGgp2WcnrpuwMCknKxlmJ7Abq3CrWStp12ptaZ5zZ6vrWWcmsOmuIyipWasmaKybrLOq2SlmaNiw6azwKxkq52jnrGmusKyZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./programme-national-nutrition-sante-les-villes-se-sont-davantage-engagees-que-les-departements.html><span>←</span><span>les villes se sont davantage engages que les dpartements</span></a>
