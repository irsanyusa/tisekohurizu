Her older sister grew up with her aunt and her older brother grew up with her father. Her mom then got remarried and Kelly got five stepbrothers and sisters. The American Idol winner was alone with her mother before that time period. Her father left when she was six years old.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link> KELLY CLARKSON AND USHER BOND OVER ‘COMPLICATED CONVERSATIONS AT HOME’ DURING DIVORCE [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><p>When asked if Kelly has spoken to her father she said: “no I’ve never really been in touch with him.” But she didn’t want people feeling sorry for her. “If you didn’t grow up with it, it’s hard to miss something you never had.” She has tried in the past to reach out to her dad because her brother insisted on all of the family coming together.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>“Even if it isn’t your father or whoever it is in your life if someone presents such a cancerous environment and then just keeps hurting you and even if they’re doing it inadvertently and they just don’t know better, you should just not have that person in your life,” she said which earned applause from the audience. “I shouldn’t have to work so much for someone’s love.”</p><p>This kind of vulnerability that Kelly is so willing to show is just one of the reasons why she is the real queen of talent. She is always so open and raw not only with her music but at all times in her life.
