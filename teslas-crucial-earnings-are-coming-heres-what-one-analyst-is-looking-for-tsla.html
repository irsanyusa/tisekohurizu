A Tesla representative told Business Insider that the timeline and information in the documents were "outdated," but did not specify any further.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Tesla's "priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster," Musk <a href=# id=45a6f9a4-f498-3509-a448-b395eace56e2>tweeted</a> in November.</p><p>"We would not be surprised to see TSLA provide an update on its product roadmap in part to help support the stock," Rusch said.</p><p>Rusch is expecting adjusted earnings of $2.85 a share on revenue of $7.4 billion.
