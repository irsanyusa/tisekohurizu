As many remember, Kinstler revealed the lost of her father while competing on American Idol in 2021. Before the Top 24 of her season she performed a powerful rendition of “<a href=#>Father</a>” by Demi Lovato, which she dedicated to her late dad.</p><p>Kinstler explains that her new song embodies the emotional journey following her father’s passing in 2020. In the statement released, she explains that her loss came with emotional turmoil. At the time she didn’t acknowledge her own feelings. She’s now at a point where she wants to share her journey of pain and struggle through music.</p><p>“It’s been quite the journey trying to navigate such polarizing emotions,” Kinstler wrote on Instagram. “The feelings and sensations are too great to fit into one single record, so my goal is that with every new release, you’ll get to understand a new piece of my story and my heart.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>This song has a laid back beat that accentuates her personal lyrics. Her pain is felt throughout the lyrics of the powerful tune. Throughout the song, the singer shows off the versatility of her voice as she hits higher notes during the passionate moments.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fans Cannot Get Enough of this Tune</h2><p>American Idol fans are loving this long overdue song from Kinstler. Ahead of this release, fans had been dying to hear more from this stand out singer. Before “Breaking Myself” her last released single was “Love Someone,” which was dropped during American Idol.</p><p>Kinstler fans hope that she will choose to sing “Breaking Myself” during her upcoming appearance on the American Idol. This American Idol alum is set to return alongside fellow finalist Willie Spence on May 2 for “The Great Idol Reunion.” They will appear alongside several <a href=#>American Idol winners</a>, as well as other fan favorites.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NUP_197277_02525.jpg alt="John Morgan Represents North Carolina in ‘American Song Contest’ Semifinals" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Grace Kinstler</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xquYnJ1doLavv9OlnKtllp67orjLsmSrnZyarrSx0macpqeknryvrctmqqiml2Kvs7HApKCnn12ixrSxy59kn5meqHqkrc2tZKCdpGKyr7vUoJ9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lady-gaga-check-out-singers-bold-gucci-look-sparkling-makeup-for-2016-super-bowl.html><span>←</span><span>Check out singer's bold Gucci look, sparkling makeup for 2016 Super Bowl</span></a>
