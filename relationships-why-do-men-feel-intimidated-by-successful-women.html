Inadequacy</p><p>There’s an undue sense of falling short in men when they are not richer or&nbsp; more successful than women. Several men can’t deal with being less successful than the women they’ll be with. It’s not right but it’s what happens.</p><p>For some, it is an ego thing.</p><p>To be not as rich or not as successful as the woman they’d date or be in a relationship with is unimaginable for them.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Isn’t that some myopic way of viewing life and relationships?</p><p>3. Society</p><p>The pattern of relationships and marriages in the society for such a long time has seen men more successful and being depended on by women and their children.</p><p>So while men might be clamouring for independent women, there are still some who [wrongly] can’t wrap their heads around having a woman who does not depend on them for anything.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>4. Perceived disrespect</p><p>There’s a belief that independent and successful women have tendencies to be disrespectful.</p><p>Some guys would argue that being dependent &nbsp;for most of their needs is one big reason why women respect &nbsp;their partners.</p><p>So when the women can meet those needs without any assistance from men, they get out of control, become disrespectful and not as submissive as they should be.</p><p>Of course, this is another defective view to have. Not all independent women are disrespectful of their spouses and disrespect is an ailment that also affects broke, dependent women.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Overall, more guys need to know that women, too, want to be successful, get ahead in life and at the same time find true love and build happy families just like men.</p><p>This drive for success and career greatness is not something that should be used against them. If anything, it is something that should even make them more desirable especially for long-term relationships and marriages, so far they know how to find that healthy balance between that and family.</p><p>If you are a man and you do not know this, you still have a lot to learn.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZL%2BmuMCtoKimo522sb%2BMsJydnJmjtLR70Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipqmavmK56pbuMppynZZaasq15yKeroqWZma61scNmmbJlo6qwpLHSrJ2upF2svK6xzWierJ2mor11</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./trans-icon-dylan-mulvaney-wins-woman-of-the-year-award-816026.html><span>←</span><span>Trans Icon Dylan Mulvaney Wins Woman of the Year Award</span></a>
