The Masked Singer stars are reprising their roles in the hit BET show, Real Husbands of Hollywood. After five years, the comedy is returning, but this time fans can watch it on BET+, the streaming service from BET.</strong></p><p>Real Husbands of Hollywood debuted back in 2013. Co-created by Kevin Hart, the show follows the daily lives of married celebrities, each playing a fictionalized version of themselves as they navigate Hollywood. The parody of Bravo’s Real Housewives franchise, was a hit. The premiere episode brought in close to 5 million viewers. The initial run lasted five seasons and earned Cannon an NAACP Image Award nomination in 2014.</p><p>When the show first premiered, Thicke was married to actress Paula Patton. Cannon was married to music icon Mariah Carey. By the time Season 3 came in 2014, both men were divorced. The show even addressed the high profile divorces throughout that season. Carey even made an appearance in Season 3. In true comedic fashion, nothing was off limits.</p><p>The new trailer shows Cannon as well as Thicke getting into more outrageous situations as they terrorize the people of Hollywood. The revival of Real Husbands of Hollywood will debut on Feb 5. <a href=#>Dancing With The Stars</a> alum, Nelly will also reprise his role.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nick-cannon-and-robin-thicke-s-friendship>Nick Cannon and Robin Thicke’s Friendship</h2><p>After spending six seasons together on The Masked Singer, it will be interesting to see the entertainers in a new setting together. Since Season 1 of the competition show, Cannon and Thicke’s relationship was pleasant to see. On a recent sit down to promote Season 6 of The Masked Singer, on Cannon’s daytime talk show, Thicke discussed the great chemistry they had.</p><p>Some of our favorite talent show stars have made cameos throughout Real Husbands of Hollywood five season run. Terry Crews, Wayne Brady, Kelly Rowland, and Faith Evans have all appeared. The celebrities that the show is able to bring on set was a driving factor in its success. Fans would tune in each week to see if their favorite stars would be joining Cannon and Thicke on screen.</p><p>Real Husbands of Hollywood originated as a BET Awards sketch. To see the success that it has had after all of these years is a testament to the characters as well as the creators. The six episode limited series will have fans craving for more.</p><p>It is hard to tell if Cannon and Thicke can commit to more episodes or another season. Cannon has his hands full with his <a href=#>Masked Singer</a> hosting duties as Season 7 is underway, and The Nick Cannon daytime talk show. Thicke has his judging duties at the show and music on the brain.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MS-S2_Gallery-Group_MB1202_V61.jpg alt="‘The Masked Singer’ Season 7 Premieres March 9 Ahead of ‘Domino Masters’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zaKapGWTlruvu81mqaiamaN6tbTInKKeZaKawba%2BzWauoqyYYr%2Bmrctmn66rkpa7pb%2BMqJ1moJ%2BhubrDzqibaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./medicine-the-foreign-route.html><span>←</span><span>Medicine: The Foreign Route | TIME</span></a>
