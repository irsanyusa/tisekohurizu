The next most popular months are June (64%) and April (61%).</p><p data-block-key=3g7pm>A majority of Brits would also be happy with a September (55%) or October (55%) election but just 46% see November as acceptable. One in three (35%) think November would be an unacceptable time to hold the election.</p><p data-block-key=5igp7>There is a similar split when it comes to August, when many families will be enjoying their summer holidays, with around half (49%) seeing an election as acceptable during this time and 31% thinking it would be unacceptable.</p><p data-block-key=d1bsa>The public would be least content if Sunak was to serve pretty much the remainder of the parliamentary term, and hold an election in December or January. Just 30% and 32% respectively consider each of these acceptable election months.</p><p data-block-key=7sr01>There is a clear partisan divide when it comes to how soon the election should be. Those intending to vote Labour are far more likely to think a spring election would be acceptable, while Conservative voters would prefer an autumn election. That said, neither sets of voters are keen on a repeat of 2019 with a December election.</p><h3 data-block-key=pq9bp id=public-split-on-how-election-dates-should-be-decided>Public split on how election dates should be decided</h3><p data-block-key=b3oe3>The Fixed-term Parliaments Act was removed in 2022, meaning the prime minister can choose the date of a general election – a fact that 70% of the public are already aware of. Just 9% think elections happen every five years on a fixed date.</p><p data-block-key=3stv>There is a divide when it comes to which of these two options Britons would prefer though, with a third (33%) opting for a fixed date five years after the last election, and 37% saying they’d prefer the prime minister to decide. While current Labour voters are also split on the issue, current Conservative voters favour the prime minister deciding by 64% to 24%.</p><p data-block-key=90k8u>There does seem to be some discrepancy, however, among those who would favour a five year fixed date in the abstract and what they want in practice. Despite their claimed preference, just 28% would actually find a December election acceptable (five years on from the last election) compared to 61% who think it would be unacceptable.</p><p data-block-key=fr8fq><a href=#><b>See the full results here</b></a></p><p data-block-key=49cbg><i>Photo: Getty</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZG2BeIOMppiyZWJlf3V5xKWcnKyZpLtuuc6sq2aokaGuta3BpZxmrJ9ivbauy6Ka</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./le-gouvernement-instaure-des-comites-operationnels-de-lutte-contre-le-racisme-et-lantisemitisme.html><span>←</span><span>Le gouvernement instaure des &amp;quot;comits oprationnels de lutte contre le racisme et l'antismitisme</span></a>
