In fact, YouGov research shows that nearly a fifth of Brits met their current or most recent partner at work.</p><p>If you’re still hopeful this cuffing season (winter officially ends on 20 March), another equally popular route to love is meeting through mutual friends (18%). More niche options include finding a partner through a shared hobby (5%) or through family (3%).</p><p>Speed dating and similar face to face events are unlikely to yield results. Less than 1% of people who have been in a relationship found their current or most recent partner this way.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Chart_1_-_new_bars-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><strong>Young people are less likely to ‘bump into’ the love of their lives</strong></p><p>Countless love stories in films and TV shows start with an unexpected encounter in a bookshop or at a bar. It does happen in real life too: one in five people aged 50 to 64 met their partner by chance while out and about.</p><p>For younger generations, such encounters are increasingly rare. Only one in twenty people aged 20 to 29 met their partner at a bar or elsewhere by chance. So if no one is asking for your number on a night out - it’s not you, it’s just your generation.</p><p>Millennial love takes a more practical approach: swiping through digital photographs. Over a fifth of 25- to 34-year-olds met their partner online – 13% through dating apps and 9% websites such as OKCupid or Guardian Soulmates.</p><p>Dating websites are most popular with people who are slightly older. One in nine 40- to 44-year-olds (11%) met their partner on a website, while apps are somewhat more unusual at 7%.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Chart_2_NEW_version-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><strong>What’s the best place to look for a partner?</strong></p><p>It depends on your age but most people still meet their partner offline - and it tends to happen where one spends a lot of time.</p><p>Young people aged 18 to 24 first spot their crushes at university (18%), school (18%) or with mutual friends (15%). In contrast, 45- to 54-year-olds meet tend to meet at work (22%), by chance (19%) or through friends (16%).</p><p>Older couples who, like Homer and Marge Simpson, met at school are rare. Only 4% of 45-to 54-year-olds met this way, while 3% found their current or most recent partner at university. These figures may change over time, as attending university is more common among younger people.</p><p>Keep an eye on our new <a href=#>trackers</a> for the most recent numbers on how Brits meet their partners.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Chart_3_new-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhqZ22BennHqK5mnJ9ir7O106xkn6GemXqtu9We</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./de-la-suppression-de-la-taxe-dhabitation-au-big-bang-fiscal.html><span>←</span><span>De la suppression de la taxe d'habitation au big bang fiscal ?</span></a>
