By using rudimentary programming skills, users could mine Tinder data <a href=# rel=noopener>to find out</a> where any other user was. To do this, someone would need to use three different accounts as a way to triangulate a target’s location, according to research by Internet security consultant Include Security. Tinder is a popular dating app that allows users to see pictures of nearby users and look for matches.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The vulnerability allowed one Tinder user to triangulate the location of another Tinder user within 100 feet,” said Erik Cabetas, the managing partner of Include Security. “You don’t need any special privilege or anything like that. All the information is gathered from the server with any Tinder user account.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">(<strong>MAGAZINE</strong>: <a href=#>The New Dating Game</a>)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s unclear if any users actually exploited the security flaw. Tinder did not immediately comment on Wednesday.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Include Security is an independent consultant that probes networks for large tech clients but flexes its hacking muscles in between major assignments. That’s how it says it first exposed the Tinder flaw last October. After notifying the dating application’s CEO, Sean Rad, Include Security received an acknowledgement and a thank-you from the company. But Cabetas said Include Security saw no change to Tinder’s security until Jan. 1, even after repeatedly checking to see whether triangulating users’ location was still possible.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tinder will now only show users’ locations in increments of a mile, Cabetas said, making triangulation much less precise.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Without the high precision we can’t do the triangulation,” Cabetas said. Though users can no longer exploit the flaw, other companies may face similar location issues, Cabetas added: “This vulnerability will become more common as applications add location-aware features.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZxbmBpfLW1zZ2cq2WRpb1uwdKeqWakn5iutbXOp2SsnZOqv6rA2GadpZmnZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maneskin-italian-rock-band-roxy-interview-1235108380.html><span>←</span><span>Meet Mneskin: The Italian Band That Defied the Odds and Brought Rock Back to the U.S.</span></a>
