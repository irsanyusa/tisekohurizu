Stop this unchristian practice that creates slavery and poverty.”</p><p>Daddy Freeze calls this a sin but what does the bible say? Here are some scriptures that make reference to this subject.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In the old testament</p><p>Proverbs 3:9–10 says, “Honor the Lord with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce; then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will be bursting with wine.”</p><p>Nehemiah 10:35—“We obligate ourselves to bring the firstfruits of our ground and the firstfruits of all fruit of every tree, year by year, to the house of the Lord.”</p><p>Ezekiel 44:30—“And the first of all the firstfruits of all kinds, and every offering of all kinds from all your offerings, shall belong to the priests. You shall also give to the priests the first of your dough, that a blessing may rest on your house.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>2 Kings 4:42—“A man came from Baal-shalishah, bringing the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And Elisha said, “Give to the men, that they may eat.”</p><p>Leviticus 23:20- “And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits as a wave offering before the Lord, with the two lambs. They shall be holy to the Lord for the priest.”</p><p>Exodus 23:19a: “The best of the firstfruits of your ground you shall bring into the house of the LORD your God.”</p><p>Numbers 18:13—“The first ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to the Lord, shall be yours. Everyone who is clean in your house may eat it.”</p><p>2 Chronicles 31:5—“As soon as the command was spread abroad, the people of Israel gave in abundance the firstfruits of grain, wine, oil, honey, and of all the produce of the field. And they brought in abundantly the tithe of everything.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Malachi 3:10—“Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. And thereby put me to the test, says the Lord of hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need.”</p><p>New Testament</p><p>In the old testament, the first fruit is used to refer to a form of giving. Here, we see the term used differently.</p><p>Romans 8:23—“And not only the creation but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit…”</p><p>1 Corinthians 15:20—“But in fact, Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.” Verse 23 adds, “But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>2 Thessalonians 2:13—“But we ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers beloved by the Lord because God chose you as the firstfruits to be saved, through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth.”</p><p>James 1:18—“ Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.”</p><p>Revelation 14:4 has the last mention of first fruits in . It reads, “It is these who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins. It is these who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These have been redeemed from mankind as firstfruits for God and the Lamb.”</p><p>What do churches say?</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>For years, different churches have translated the one term in various ways. For some, there is no need to give your first fruit since the law no longer applies while others encourage their members to continue to give their first fruits.</p><p>Christ Embassy</p><p>Pastor Chris Oyakhilome supports this type of offering. In the video above, he teaches viewers on the benefits of giving one's first fruit.</p><p>In his words, "So, He is letting us know there is an abundant harvest returning to you on your giving. And remember when God tells you to do something it is in your interest..."</p><p>Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG)</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Pastor Adeboye’s church sees it as the secret to “overwhelming blessing.”</p><p>This issue is discussed on the church’s official website in a post titled: ‘First Fruit Offering.’</p><p>The concluding part reads: “God’s intention is that Man lives a life of true dominion, comfort and overwhelming blessings. However, realizing this divine desire depends on Man’s prompt, total and consistent obedience to God’s instructions, one of which is giving of FIRSTFRUIT OFFERING.”</p><p>Mountain of Fire</p><p>This church definitely encourages the first fruit offering as seen in an excerpt from the book “The Mystery of First Fruit Offering”.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Pastor D.K. Olukoya writes, “The Lord does not want you to miss out on the blessings of the first fruit offering. Whether you are trading in corn, oil or poultry, you must give your fruit offering to the Lord.</p><p>“The world-class businessman, the petty trader, the university professor and the owner of a multinational company are all expected to give their first fruit offerings.”</p><p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</p><p>This church holds to the interpretation found in the new testament.</p><p>According to The Book of Mormon, “the Holy Messiah, who layeth down his life according to the flesh, and taketh it again by the power of the Spirit, that he may bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, being the first that should rise. Wherefore, he is the firstfruits unto God”.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksLC5zK6loqyZmsBwvsSloKChn6N8pa3DnbBmnqKasruxjLCfmqxdmbymv4ytn55lkp6vrbGMq5yapJyuerSt2GaYm6elqXqntdGsq2aeoqq2tb%2BOn6KgnGGggw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./label-bas-carbone-une-methode-pour-la-vegetalisation-des-villes-soumise-consultation.html><span>←</span><span>une mthode pour la vgtalisation des villes soumise consultation</span></a>
