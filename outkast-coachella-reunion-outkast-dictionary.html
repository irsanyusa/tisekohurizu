The group, who released their debut album as teenagers twenty years ago, had an impressive decade-long run in which they rewrote the rules of hip-hop as they went along. In addition to bringing the soulful sound of southern rap to a mainstream audience with hits like “Rosa Parks,” “Ms. Jackson” and “So Fresh, So Clean,” the group is particularly known for its inventive use of language: they helped make the Southern dialect cool to fans the world over. They also really, really love portmanteaus. Before you go to one of the 40 concerts that Big Boi and Andre 3000 have planned for this year, it’s worth brushing up on your OutKast lingo a bit.
