Those who fell in the middle — occasional drinkers of diet soda — gained about 1.8 in.</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=361>&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph -->&lt;!-- wp:gutenberg-custom-blocks/video-jw {"mediaId":"SSdTN2EQ","autostart":false} --></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=367>&lt;!-- /wp:gutenberg-custom-blocks/video-jw -->&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=371>That change in waist circumference is especially concerning because it highlights an unfortunate truth about weight distribution: the belly is a bad place for extra pounds.

Though scientists are still puzzling through the mechanisms by which diet soda seems to have the unintended consequence of weight gain, they have some ideas. Sugar-free sodas contain substances that sweeten up soda at 200-600 times the sweetness of sugar.</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=386>&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph -->&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=389><a rel href=# data-reactid=390>As TIME has previously reported</a>, some experts believe that artificial sweeteners trigger sweetness receptors in the brain, which cause the body to prepare itself for an influx of calories. Even though those calories don’t arrive, the body still craves them, and that may cause people to ultimately eat more calories overall, putting them at a risk for weight gain.</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=393>&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph -->&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=396>“Regular sugar has caloric consequences,” says the study’s senior author Dr. Helen Hazuda, professor of medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. And one of those is that it triggers satiety — a sense of fullness or satisfaction. “Your body is used to knowing that a sweet taste means you are ingesting energy in the form of calories that, if you don’t burn them off, is going to convert to fat,” she says. Artificial sweeteners, however, confuse our bodies and weaken the link in our brains between sweetness and calories. That, Hazuda says, can lead to weight gain and cravings for sweeter and sweeter treats.</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=398>&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph -->&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=401>There may be something else at work. A recent <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=# data-reactid=403>study</a> in mice showed that artificial sweeteners actually changed the gut bacteria of mice in ways that made them vulnerable to insulin resistance and glucose intolerance — both of which can lead to weight gain. And other mice research suggests that artificial sweeteners are associated with a drop in the appetite-regulating hormone leptin, Hazuda says. Leptin is the hormone that inhibits hunger.</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=406>&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph -->&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=409><strong data-reactid=410>MORE </strong><a rel=noopener href=# data-reactid=411>13 Ways to Stop Drinking Soda for Good</a></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=413>&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph -->&lt;!-- wp:gutenberg-custom-blocks/video-jw {"mediaId":"nwMvhaug","autostart":false} --></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=419>&lt;!-- /wp:gutenberg-custom-blocks/video-jw -->&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=423>The Calorie Control Council, an association that represents the reduced-calorie food and beverage industry — including alternative sweeteners — disagreed with the study’s findings. “The use of low-calorie sweeteners (LCSs) in weight management has been shown to be beneficial,” the group said in a statement. “While approaches to treat obesity in older individuals is controversial, diet modifications can be a successful part of a weight-management program for older adults.”</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=425>&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph -->&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --></p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=428>Researchers in the new study found that belly-fat gain was most pronounced in people who were already overweight. “People who are already at cardiometabolic risk because they have higher BMIs are really in double or triple jeopardy,” Hazuda says. “When they think they’re doing something good by drinking artificially sweetened beverages, it’s actually totally counterproductive.”</p><p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 end text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4" data-reactid=430>&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmacp5yhsqTAyKilaJ%2BlnrGmedOoZLCdmZy1tXnLqKqsZ2NsgXd8k3BmnaGVqXq0u8OaZLCdmZy1tXnGmqCnZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-harry-styles-just-blind-audition-his-own-song-for-the-voice.html><span>←</span><span>Did Harry Styles Just Blind Audition His Own Song For 'The Voice'?!</span></a>
