However, most of Gen Z’s “favorites” are pros: Collegiate players made up less than 1 percent of favorite sports figure responses in the poll.</p><p class=mb-s>Leonsis and Browning also said esports are an effective way for traditional sports properties to reach young fans, something the NHL has done through the NHL Gaming World Championship.</p><p class=mb-s>“The NHL is slowly but surely making its own footprint in the esports world to hopefully bridge the gap with young fans who maybe don't live near an ice rink, but play the NHL video game and get to know different teams and different players that way,” Leonsis said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX5yyr3nZZqeopJxiwLG70a2qZp6Ro7GwuQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./quote-kate-middleton-loves-anne-of-green-gables.html><span>←</span><span>QUOTE: Kate Middleton Loves Anne of Green Gables</span></a>
