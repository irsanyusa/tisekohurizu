When I was struggling with back pain and poor sleep, I bought the DreamCloud Premier hybrid queen mattress. Buying a mattress I hadn’t been able to actually feel and lie down on was a big jump for me; previously, I’d only bought mattresses after trying them in stores. I was pleasantly surprised with not only how well the DreamCloud Premier worked for me, but with the mattress’ overall quality. I’ve now owned the mattress for three years and credit it with helping to reduce my back pain for better sleep and overall better health. Available as both a hybrid and a memory foam mattress, the DreamCloud Premier is versatile . Read on to see if it might be the right choice for you.</p><h2 id=mattress-specifications>Mattress specifications</h2><ul><li><strong>Material:</strong> Hybrid mattress is foam, memory foam, and steel coils; memory foam mattress is foam and memory foam</li><li><strong>Firmness:</strong> Medium firm (6.5/10)</li><li><strong>Trial period:</strong> 365 nights</li><li><strong>Warranty:</strong> Lifetime</li><li><strong>Shipping method:</strong> FedEx Ground</li><li><strong>Price range:</strong> $649-$1,149 for the hybrid, $749 - $1,249 for the memory foam</li></ul><h2 id=dreamcloud-premier-mattress-pros-and-cons>DreamCloud Premier Mattress pros and cons</h2><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>Available as a hybrid or memory foam mattress</li><li>Can be installed on any firm, solid bed base</li><li>Excellent overall support and edge support</li><li>Prevents motion transfer well&nbsp;</li><li>Features a 365-night sleep trial</li><li>Backed by a lifetime warranty</li><li>Premium In-Home Setup service available</li><li>Pillows, sheet sets, and mattress protectors available as an add-on</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><h4></h4><ul><li>13-inch height requires deep sheets</li><li>Heavy and a bit awkward to carry</li><li>May be too firm for lighter side sleepers</li></ul><p><h3 class=title>DreamCloud Premier Hybrid</h3></p><h2 id=dreamcloud-premier-mattress-price>DreamCloud Premier Mattress price</h2><p>The <a rel=nofollow href=#>DreamCloud Premier</a> hybrid mattress starts at $649 for a Twin and goes up to $1,149 for a California King mattress. The memory foam version of this mattress is slightly more expensive, ranging from $749 to $1,249.</p><p>Shipping is free, and the mattress is backed by an impressive DreamCloud Lifetime Warranty. According to DreamCloud, if your mattress becomes damaged from normal use at any time while the original purchaser owns the mattress, DreamCloud will replace or repair the mattress at no charge. That includes replacing or repairing impressions in the mattress 1.5 inches or deeper.</p><h2 id=dreamcloud-premier-mattress-design>DreamCloud Premier Mattress design</h2><p>The DreamCloud Premier Mattress is designed to provide comfortable support without being too hot. That’s accomplished through using multiple layers and materials.</p><p>The hybrid mattress features an eight-layer construction:</p><ul><li>Cashmere blend cover for breathability</li><li>Quilted foam for contouring</li><li>Quilted foam for support</li><li>Gel-infused memory foam</li><li>Transition layer</li><li>Individually wrapped steel coils</li><li>Base layer for stability</li><li>Lower cover</li></ul><p>The memory foam mattress is constructed with seven layers:</p><ul><li>Cashmere blend cover for breathability</li><li>Quilted foam for contouring</li><li>Quilted foam for support</li><li>Gel-infused memory foam</li><li>Transition layer</li><li>Base layer for stability</li><li>Lower cover</li></ul><p>The cashmere cover is light and breathable, but also feels soft and comfortable. The cooling gel memory foam also helps to disperse heat. Since the hybrid mattress’ steel springs are individually wrapped, the springs move independently, which helps to prevent motion transfer. The memory foam mattress uses a memory foam layer in place of the springs, which is also known for its excellent ability to prevent motion transfer.</p><p><h3 class=title>DreamCloud Premier Hybrid</h3></p><h2 id=dreamcloud-premier-mattress-firmness>DreamCloud Premier Mattress firmness</h2><p>DreamCloud advertises the Premier as a medium firm mattress, rating it a 6.5 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being soft and 10 being firm. I find this firmness description accurate.</p><p>Prior to owning the DreamCloud Premier, I always gravitated toward softer mattresses, but often found that they lacked the support that my back needed. Mattresses for back pain need to provide plenty of support, and tend to be firmer. Still, I was nervous that this mattress would be too firm, and when I first laid on it, I wondered how comfortable I would be. However, the foam layers, which are toward the top, provided just enough give and softness for me to sleep comfortably.</p><p>This medium firmness is ideal for many sleepers. It combines support and comfort without being so firm that it feels rigid or restricting. However, consider your preferred sleeping positions when deciding on your ideal mattress firmness. The best mattresses for side sleepers are often softer to medium-firm mattresses, which can help to relieve pressure on the shoulders and hips while supporting body alignment. Medium-firm mattresses are often ideal for back sleepers, since they support the spine and help to keep it in alignment. Stomach sleepers, though, may need a firm mattress to help keep their bodies in alignment and prevent their hips from sinking, which can result in back pain.</p><h2 id=dreamcloud-premier-mattress-support-and-comfort>DreamCloud Premier Mattress support and comfort</h2><p>The DreamCloud Premier excels when it comes to support and comfort. While I can’t attest to the support provided by the memory foam version of the mattress, I was surprised to find just how supportive the hybrid mattress provides.</p><p>I had been experiencing significant back pain while using my previous mattress. It lacked support, so whether I slept on my side or my back, I experienced lower back pain within a few hours. I frequently felt like my hips were sinking while lying on my back.</p><p>With the DreamCloud Premier, I experienced an immediate improvement. I’ve never felt like my hips were sinking with the DreamCloud mattress, and I experienced an immediate reduction in back pain. That support is because of the individually wrapped coils, which move independently to provide appropriate support. While the mattress is supportive, it doesn’t feel too stiff or too firm.</p><p>The coils contribute to its excellent edge support, too. The coils on the perimeter are thicker than the interior coils to maximize support. As a result, the edge of the mattress feels firm, and I can sit on the edge of the bed without sinking forward or from side to side. Additionally, I can push off of the bed edge to lift myself up. The mattress would be suitable for anyone who needs to use the mattress edge to help themselves into or out of bed.</p><p>That excellent support extends to the mattress’ comfort. While it took a few days to get used to the mattress being firmer than what I was used to, I quickly felt comfortable. I don’t feel that this mattress sleeps warm, and since you don’t sink into it as you can with a soft mattress, it results in an overall cooler feel. Plus, the reduction in my back pain allowed me to get better quality sleep with the DreamCloud Premier.</p><h2 id=dreamcloud-premier-mattress-performance>DreamCloud Premier Mattress performance</h2><p>This mattress is not only supportive and comfortable, the upper layers of memory foam help to prevent motion transfer. I have a 13-pound cat who loves to jump onto my bed at night and then walk around me. I can’t feel any vibration, even when she’s walking next to me.</p><p>Having slept on the DreamCloud Premier Mattress nightly for more than three years, I can attest that this mattress performs impressively well over time. Whereas all of my previous mattresses would be showing indentations and wear in the area where I sleep after a few years, my DreamCloud mattress still looks brand new. There are no visible indents, and I can’t feel any difference in support or firmness when comparing the area where I sleep to the rest of the mattress.</p><p>DreamCloud backs this mattress with a limited lifetime warranty—another testament to its performance and overall quality. Knowing that the company stands behind its mattress with such a warranty contributed to my decision to initially purchase the mattress. Having seen how this mattress performs, I understand how the company can offer such a warranty—based on the performance so far, it’s unlikely that they need to repair or replace many mattresses.</p><p><h3 class=title>DreamCloud Premier Hybrid</h3></p><h2 id=dreamcloud-premier-mattress-delivery-and-setup>DreamCloud Premier Mattress delivery and setup</h2><p>Shipping is free within the contiguous United States, and most deliveries take seven to 14 days. The mattress is shipped via FedEx Ground, and it arrives vacuum packed in a large cardboard box. You can use your DreamCloud Mattress on any hard, flat surface, such as a box spring or bed base. To assemble the mattress, open the box and lay the mattress on a frame or box spring. After you open the plastic packaging, the mattress starts to expand, and it features large, durable handles that make it easy to pull it into place.</p><p>You can sleep on the mattress that night, but it takes about 72 hours before the mattress will expand to its full size. I slept on my mattress the first night and didn’t notice any significant expansion in the following days. I was also pleased to find that the mattress had minimal offgassing, and the smell dissipated after leaving the windows open for a couple of hours.</p><p>If you don’t want to worry about the setup process, DreamCloud offers a Premium In-Home Setup service for $199. During the setup, a local service provider in your area will receive the order and then deliver it to your home, set up your new mattress, and remove your old mattress.</p><p>Since the mattress is 13 inches high, I would recommend considering the ideal height you want your completed bed to be. You may need to choose a lower bed frame or go without a box spring to help minimize the height. I’ve found that this taller mattress usually requires deep-pocket sheets. Queen comforters only partially cover the sides of my queen mattress, so you may want to purchase a comforter one size larger than your mattress for fuller coverage.</p><h2 id=is-dreamcloud-premier-mattress-for-you-who-is-this-mattress-best-for>Is DreamCloud Premier Mattress for you? Who is this mattress best for?</h2><p>With its medium firmness, the DreamCloud Premier mattress is a middle-of-the-line firmness that can work for a variety of sleepers. It provides excellent comfort and support, so it’s suitable for back and stomach sleepers, as well as lighter side sleepers. Heavier side sleepers may prefer a softer mattress to help prevent pressure points. The mattress could make a positive difference for people like me, who need a little extra support to help relieve and prevent back pain.</p><p>Since the mattress features multiple foam layers that help prevent motion transfer, it’s an ideal choice for couples or for anyone who allows pets to join them in bed. Its availability in seven sizes contributes to its versatility, and the lifetime warranty means it’s a great choice for anyone looking for a durable, quality mattress for long-term use.</p><h2 id=what-sets-dreamcloud-premier-mattress-apart-from-other-mattresses>What sets DreamCloud Premier Mattress apart from other mattresses?</h2><p>The DreamCloud Premier mattress features quality construction and provides fantastic support and comfort. While the mattress itself is excellent, the 365-night sleep trial and lifetime warranty set it apart from other mattress options.</p><p>Buying a mattress online can be filled with uncertainty, but you can try the mattress in your home for up to a year and return it—a compelling reason to try this one. If that sleep trial doesn’t build your confidence in DreamCloud, the mattress’ lifetime warranty will. A few other companies, like Nectar and Puffy, offer lifetime warranties, but often, mattress warranties are only good for 10 or 20 years. This warranty helps DreamCloud stand out.</p><h2 id=how-does-dreamcloud-premier-mattress-compare-to-other-mattresses>How does DreamCloud Premier Mattress compare to other mattresses?</h2><h3>Nectar Premier Mattress vs DreamCloud Premier Mattress</h3><p>Since Nectar and DreamCloud are brands owned by Resident, the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Nectar Premier Mattress</a> features a similar construction to the DreamCloud Premier mattress. Like the DreamCloud mattress, the Nectar mattress is 13 inches tall. However, it consists of just seven layers, and doesn’t include the DreamCloud’s gel-infused memory foam layer. Both mattresses are available in hybrid and memory foam options, and both are a medium firm.</p><p>The <a rel=alternate href=#>Nectar Premier Mattress</a> starts at $549 and costs up to $1,399, while the DreamCloud Premier price ranges from $749 to $1,249. Both mattresses feature a 365-night sleep trial and a lifetime warranty.</p><h3>DreamCloud vs DreamCloud Premier Mattress</h3><p>The <a rel=nofollow href=#>DreamCloud mattress</a> is DreamCloud’s signature mattress. It measures 12 inches tall and features two inches of gel memory foam instead of the Premier’s three-inch layer. The DreamCloud mattress offers slightly less support and comfort than the Premier. Like the Premier, the DreamCloud is available in a hybrid or memory foam design. The DreamCloud mattress costs $419 to $1,090, while the Premier costs a bit more, ranging from $749 to $1,249.</p><h3>DreamCloud Premier vs DreamCloud Premier Rest</h3><p>The <a rel=nofollow href=#>DreamCloud Premier Rest</a> is DreamCloud’s most premium mattress. It’s nearly identical to the DreamCloud Premier, but has an extra inch of gel memory foam and measures 14 inches tall, as compared to the Premier’s 13-inch height. That extra foam helps to increase motion isolation and comfort. Both of these mattresses are medium-firm.</p><p>The DreamCloud Premier Rest costs slightly more than the DreamCloud Premier. The Premier Rest hybrid and memory foam mattresses range from $949 to $2,198, while the Premier hybrid and memory foam mattresses cost $649 to $1,249.</p><h3>DreamCloud Premier Mattress vs Nolah Natural</h3><p>The <a rel=nofollow href=#>Nolah Natural mattress</a> is a latex hybrid mattress made with hypoallergenic Talalay latex and an organic cotton cover. This 11-inch mattress features latex in place of the memory foam used in the DreamCloud mattress. It also features support coils arranged in three support zones. The Nolah Natural is a luxury firm, measuring between a 5 and six, so it may be more comfortable to lighter side sleepers than the DreamCloud Premier.</p><p>The Nolah Natural is more expensive than the DreamCloud Premier, costing between $974 and $2,209. The DreamCloud Premier hybrid costs $649 to $1,158.</p><p><h3 class=title>DreamCloud Premier Hybrid</h3></p><h2 id=dreamcloud-premier-mattress-frequently-asked-questions-faqs>DreamCloud Premier Mattress frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Is the DreamCloud Premier Mattress too firm?</h3><p>The DreamCloud Premier Mattress has a medium firm feel, but it features a contoured design so you feel supported without uncomfortable pressure points. Sleepers used to a soft mattress might find it too firm.</p><h3>Is the DreamCloud Premier Mattress good for side sleepers?</h3><p>Many side sleepers, especially those who are lighter in weight, prefer a softer mattress that allows their shoulders and hips to sink down into the mattress a bit. Since the DreamCloud Premier is a medium firm mattress, it might be too firm for some side sleepers. However, I sleep partially on my side and find the mattress comfortable.</p><h3>What type of mattress is DreamCloud Premier Mattress?</h3><p>The DreamCloud Premier Mattress is available as a hybrid mattress or as a memory foam mattress. The mattress is designed to provide comfort, support, and motion isolation.</p><h3>Is the DreamCloud Premier Mattress worth it?</h3><p>The DreamCloud Premier Mattress is a quality mattress that’s comfortable. It provides excellent support and is a particularly ideal choice for back and stomach sleepers. The mattress offers excellent value, and it’s backed by a 365-night sleep trial just in case it’s not the right choice for you.</p><h3>Is it easy to return a DreamCloud Premier Mattress?</h3><p>Since DreamCloud offers a 365-night risk-free sleep trial, you can easily return the mattress within that first year. You can call, chat, or email the customer service team to arrange a return.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>The DreamCloud Premier mattress is an excellent choice for many sleepers. It’s particularly well-suited to stomach and back sleepers, thanks to its individually wrapped coils and overall support. This mattress may also work well for heavier side sleepers; whether it works well for light side sleepers will depend on their firmness preferences.</p><p>In addition to its overall support, the mattress offers excellent edge support, so it’s a practical choice for anyone who might depend on the mattress edge to help them into and out of bed. Its ability to prevent motion transfer makes it ideal for couples and those with pets, and since the mattress sleeps cool, it will appeal to anyone who tends to sleep hot.</p><p>The DreamCloud Premier features an impressive lifetime warranty, so you can purchase the mattress with confidence. And, even if you’re worried about buying a mattress without being able to try it out in a store, the DreamCloud’s 365-night sleep trial gives you plenty of time to test it out in your home and make sure that it’s the right mattress for you.</p><p><h3 class=title>DreamCloud Premier Hybrid</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8OrnJqlk6G8trCMqamepZmav265wK2rq52jqHqzsdWinLBn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-animals-that-got-soaking-wet-and-we-couldnt-laugh-any-harder-at-them-795944.html><span>←</span><span>15 Animals That Got Soaking Wet and We Couldnt Laugh Any Harder at Them</span></a>
