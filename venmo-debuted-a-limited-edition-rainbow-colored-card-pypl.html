So far, that push is going well: 29% of customers engaged in a monetized Venmo transaction by the end of 2018; and the service generated $200 million in revenue in Q4 2018.</p><p>But full monetization is still a ways away: In an interview with <a href=# id=72f06ddc-9ecd-365f-a736-3a56bf49ec4f>CNBC</a> this week, PayPal CEO Bill Ready noted that the firm doesnt expect profitability from Venmo for at least the next two quarters, but that the app could be a very profitable one for us over the medium to long term, marking the first time the firm has given a time frame for Venmo monetization.</p><p>Taking steps to boost the Venmo card, which earns revenue from merchant-assessed per-transaction fees, could be one such tactic that helps the firm execute on this goal as it moves into 2019.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO: <span id=eedc0fda-f29a-3214-aa6d-e71a1e74fd9a>The Payment Industry Ecosystem: The trend towards digital payments and key players moving markets</span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7xaKlmqaTmny3sc2mpmaclZfCtbHDZphmpJmitrWxw2acnaGknryvedGaoKean6x6pLvLqKmenF2YrrOwjKmwqaRfr4N6usmkqw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1423717-streamer-kandylands-biography-age-height-after-html.html><span>←</span><span>Streamer Kandyland's biography: age, height, before and after</span></a>
