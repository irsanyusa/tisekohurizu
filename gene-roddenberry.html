His early scriptwriting credits included Highway Patrol and Have Gun – Will Travel.</p><p>In 1964, he developed the idea for Star Trek, leading to the show's premiere two years later. Despite early struggles with acceptance and ratings, the series broke new ground with its diverse cast and was revived in popularity through syndication. Star Trek's success laid the groundwork for multiple sequels and feature films.</p><p>Roddenberry's declining health later limited his involvement in Star Trek: The Next Generation.
