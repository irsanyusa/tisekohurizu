Before he judged the singing from those who are behind the extravagant costumes on The Masked Singer, Jeong was entertaining us on the big screen. Jeong has a list of memorable movie roles that continue to make us laugh out loud. His energy is infectious and his wit is quick. Let’s take a look at some of his best roles to date.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-hangover-parts-1-3>‘The Hangover’ Parts 1 -3</h2><p>When the Hangover first premiered in 2009, audiences flocked to watch the raunchy comedy. The story about best buds and their drunken antics in Vegas was a box office hit. The Bradley Cooper film grossed nearly $500 Million. Jeong played Asian mobster, Mr. Chow. Jeong stole every scene he was in.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Transformers Dark of The Moon’</h2><p>Fans of Transformers will remember Jeong’s scene stealing moment. In the action film, Jeong plays Jerry Wang, a NASA employee. During a scene with Shia Labeouf, Jeong’s character is shown in a panic state. He has been blackmailed by a Decepticon into helping their cause to take over the world. In true fashion for the comedian, he made the role his and shares a hilarious bathroom scene with Labeouf’s character. Unfortunately, Jeong’s character met his fate by being thrown out of a glass window.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Knocked Up’</h2><p>The Judge Apatow game changing comedy, Knocked Up introduced us to Jeong. He already made brief appearances on television shows, but it wasn’t until Knocked Up wrapped that Jeong quit his medical career to pursue acting full time. In the film Jeong plays the memorable Dr. Kuni. Who could forget Jeong’s raunchy scene where he explained to Katherine Heigl’s character how her baby delivery could go?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Role Models’</h2><p>Jeong was offered the role of King Argotron in the Paul Rudd comedy, Role Models. In the movie, Jeong’s character is the main antagonist in the 2008 film. He is obsessed with re-enacting war battles and hilarity ensues. Throughout the movie audiences laughed to their stomaches hurt as Jeong’s delusional character tortured the movie’s stars.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Crazy Rich Asians’</h2><p>Crazy Rich Asians was a box office smash. The comedy helped Asian representation in Hollywood progress. Jeong knew the importance of the film, that is why he begged to be in the film. The comedian played Goh Wye Mun, the patriarch of a newly wealthy family in Singapore. His extravagant father character added to the spectacle movie that everyone could not stop talking about. The film scored a 90% on<a href=#> Rotten Tomatoes</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1357791899.jpg alt="Friendships From ‘Dancing with the Stars’ Season 30 That Will Warm Your Heart" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>ken jeong</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xaumpmWknbJutMCnnqiulad6tbuMnKmasqliv6qvx2aYrKGRo8But8SnZKOdn6O0tHnBnqqtZZ2kw6qxjKumpZ2jYsGwecOaq55n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./everything-you-need-to-know-about-guava-island-a-new-film-starring-rihanna-and-donald.html><span>←</span><span>Everything you need to know about 'Guava Island,' a new film starring Rihanna and Donald Glover</span></a>
