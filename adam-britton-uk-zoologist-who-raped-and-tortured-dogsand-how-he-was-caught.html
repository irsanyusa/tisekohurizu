He shared that he started raping horses at the age of 13 in these chatrooms.</p><p>He even taught them how to do the same; when asked what he does with the animals who die, he said he feeds them to other animals—presumably the eight crocodiles he harbours.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>His lawyer argued that Britton had struggled with intense and atypical sexual interests since childhood.</p><p>In addition to his prison sentence, Britton has been banned for life from owning or being in contact with animals. He expressed regret for his actions in a letter read in court, claiming his crimes were driven by a rare disorder.</p><p>Britton's sentence brings an end to a sad chapter in which he caused unimaginable agony to animals, deceived their owners, and publicly shared his misdeeds.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6lrcxmmauhpKm8r3nUpGSzp5%2BhvKi10q1ksKCfYr%2BivMSdZJqmlGLBsL7TrqmenF2ZvKi%2FwKebZqCfrHqpsYywmKxlk5bCqLTTaLGtaqGhsXg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./relocalisations.html><span>←</span><span>24-11-2022 | Relocalisations</span></a>
