Because you’re my best friend, and you’re my dad.'”</p><p>For his audition, Jon Wayne performed an original song called “Tell Me Ray.” The judges invited Ray into the audition room so he could listen to his grandson perform.

Bryan said he “showcased the right foundation of what we’re looking for.” Katy Perry told him, “You’ve got so many stories inside of you.”</p><p>Jon Wayne earned a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Golden Ticket to Hollywood</a> for his performance.
