Most likely, “cold, snow, <a href=# title=ice data-link=tag>ice</a>, and penguins.” Yet, this is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the least explored regions in&nbsp;the world that hides many strange and unique things. Check them out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bf5/b89/77dba25adfae470d1f11757ae0.png><p>You don’t have to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;Antarctica to&nbsp;see this weird thing. All you need to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;open Google Earth and move to&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the southernmost islands of&nbsp;Antarctica&nbsp;— King George Island. Recently, Internet users have noticed a&nbsp;large and pretty strange cave entrance there. Where does this wide dark passage lead? People started making suggestions.</p><p>“It’s the entrance to&nbsp;a&nbsp;secret base or&nbsp;some laboratory!” “This is&nbsp;part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;spaceship that crashed there thousands of&nbsp;years ago.” “This is&nbsp;the door to&nbsp;the ancient city of&nbsp;Antarctica.” “Perhaps, there’s a&nbsp;giant rock mountain with an&nbsp;ancient cave beneath all this snow and ice.” Well, there’s some ideas. Users have calculated the approximate dimensions of&nbsp;this cave. It&nbsp;might be&nbsp;about 74&nbsp;feet high and 250 feet wide. You can hide a&nbsp;Boeing passenger jet in&nbsp;there!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/53e/fec/603a1e5cfd96f0ffae4643f5a5.png><p><a href=# title=Nature data-link=tag>Nature</a> probably created this entrance. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;logical explanation, but there are two strange factors. First, take a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the foot of&nbsp;the mountain. It&nbsp;seems that there are steps there. They’re dark in&nbsp;color&nbsp;— as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they are made of&nbsp;stone. And if&nbsp;you look closely, you can notice something similar to&nbsp;human footprints. Has anyone entered this cave? Or&nbsp;maybe someone is&nbsp;still living there now? The second oddity is&nbsp;the disappearance of&nbsp;the mysterious finding. For the first time, people noticed it&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Google Maps snap in&nbsp;2007. Then the entrance disappeared. Then, it&nbsp;reappeared a&nbsp;few years later. After that, it&nbsp;vanished. And in&nbsp;2022, people saw it&nbsp;again.</p><p>Perhaps, old snow melts, a&nbsp;new layer falls, then the wind blows it&nbsp;away, and the cycle repeats. But the alleged steps leading deep into the cave make one doubt the natural origin of&nbsp;this tunnel. You can easily find the coordinates on&nbsp;the Internet and visit the cave via Google Earth. You might see something there and tell the world!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bee/620/3e1fd052c2b20fe16b9a7dc781.png><p>There’s another strange thing people discovered with the help of&nbsp;Google Earth. In&nbsp;2020, one user found a&nbsp;strange object that looked like a&nbsp;giant ship 100 miles off the coast of&nbsp;Antarctica. It&nbsp;was covered with ice and snow and lying on&nbsp;its side. It&nbsp;looked like a&nbsp;cruise ship. You could notice the windows, the deck, and the bridge... But not all people agreed with this. Some claimed it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;spaceship. Others said it&nbsp;was some kind of&nbsp;secret building. The user who had first noticed “the ship” stated that its size was about 400 feet&nbsp;— which is&nbsp;the perfect length for a&nbsp;passenger vessel. But what is&nbsp;this ship doing in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;remote place in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;a&nbsp;glacier? How did it&nbsp;get here? Who was its captain? No&nbsp;one has found the answers to&nbsp;these questions yet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/069/e8d/ad461c545bbf061ef8609b0ce1.png><p>In&nbsp;2016, people using Google Earth discovered a&nbsp;photo of&nbsp;an&nbsp;unknown sea monster floating off the coast of&nbsp;Antarctica. This creature resembled a&nbsp;giant squid with a&nbsp;length of&nbsp;about 200&nbsp;feet! This is&nbsp;slightly shorter than three train cars. Just imagine this giant Kraken swimming in&nbsp;Antarctica’s dark, icy waters and dragging to&nbsp;the bottom everything it&nbsp;meets on&nbsp;its way. Maybe it’s the great and terrible Cthulhu or&nbsp;one of&nbsp;its offspring?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f7f/55c/0b3fc85e9898549942ffd660ff.png><p>You will quickly notice this blood-red waterfall among Antarctica’s endless dazzling white landscapes. Don’t worry&nbsp;— it’s not blood. For many centuries, the waterfall has been painting snow in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bright red color. The stream flows straight out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;white iceberg. Let’s look inside and find out what’s happening there. Millions of&nbsp;years ago, there was a&nbsp;small crystal-clear pond. But then a&nbsp;glacier formed around&nbsp;it. A&nbsp;thick layer of&nbsp;ice and snow blocked sunlight, heat, and oxygen access. For millennia, the reservoir remained in&nbsp;this cold vacuum. But at&nbsp;one point, the water made a&nbsp;hole in&nbsp;the icy wall and broke out. When this salty water comes into contact with oxygen, it&nbsp;immediately turns scarlet or&nbsp;rusty. Antarctica is&nbsp;the only place where you can find such a&nbsp;unique natural phenomenon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b36/f48/aaaca05ccb8be0659bcd59e0cb.png><p>One of&nbsp;the driest places on&nbsp;Earth is&nbsp;located in&nbsp;Antarctica. It’s one of&nbsp;the most lifeless deserts in&nbsp;the world&nbsp;— the McMurdo Dry Valleys. In&nbsp;this <a href=# title=desert data-link=tag>desert</a>, you won’t see the scorching sun, hot sand, and cacti. A&nbsp;desert means a&nbsp;place with a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;precipitation and life. The McMurdo Dry Valleys meet these parameters. But this place is&nbsp;also unique for Antarctica since you won’t find glaciers there. Despite the frost, ice can’t form in&nbsp;the desert because it&nbsp;hasn’t rained for millions of&nbsp;years there. It&nbsp;also never snows. A&nbsp;strong wind coming down from the mountains reaches speeds of&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;200 miles per hour. It’d be&nbsp;difficult for you to&nbsp;stay on&nbsp;your feet there. The wind is&nbsp;filled with moisture. It&nbsp;heats up&nbsp;and evaporates all the liquid and snow in&nbsp;the desert because of&nbsp;its high speed. Only dry air reaches the ground.</p><p>But you can find several lakes there. They don’t freeze only thanks to&nbsp;the high concentration of&nbsp;salt. The water is&nbsp;so&nbsp;salty that large life forms can’t develop there. But scientists have found microscopic organisms near the lakes. Twenty million years ago, Antarctica was filled with swamps and trees and swarming with insects and animals. But now, it&nbsp;resembles the surface of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Mars data-link=tag>Mars</a>, literally. Scientists and astronauts are exploring such regions as&nbsp;the McMurdo Dry Valleys since the natural conditions there are similar to&nbsp;those on&nbsp;the Red Planet. So, before you go&nbsp;to&nbsp;Mars, you can practice living in&nbsp;similar places on&nbsp;Earth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/de6/18e/59644c5650aa8b502a343497f5.png><p>Also, scientists discovered an&nbsp;underwater world in&nbsp;the Antarctic filled with hundreds of&nbsp;amphipods&nbsp;— crustacean animals similar to&nbsp;shrimps. Wait a&nbsp;minute. It&nbsp;happened in&nbsp;the Antarctic. But the McMurdo Dry Valleys are located in&nbsp;Antarctica. The words are very similar, but what is&nbsp;the difference? Oh, and don’t forget about the Arctic! The Antarctic is&nbsp;the region in&nbsp;the southernmost part of&nbsp;Earth that houses the continent of&nbsp;Antarctica. And the Arctic is&nbsp;another land altogether. They have the same natural conditions&nbsp;— frost, ice, and snow. But they are located in&nbsp;different parts of&nbsp;the planet. The Arctic is&nbsp;at&nbsp;the North Pole. Antarctica is&nbsp;at&nbsp;the South Pole. Now, back to&nbsp;the discovery. Scientists put forward theories that the ice of&nbsp;the Antarctic hides a&nbsp;vast network of&nbsp;freshwater rivers and lakes. And in&nbsp;2022, they found a&nbsp;new ecosystem. Researchers explored the Antarctic Ross ice shelf and its underground rivers. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;massive piece of&nbsp;ice floating in&nbsp;the ocean.</p><p>A&nbsp;team from New Zealand used a&nbsp;special drilling rig equipped with a&nbsp;hot water supply to&nbsp;drill a&nbsp;hole 1,640 feet deep&nbsp;— that’s more than the height of&nbsp;the Empire State Building. Then, they lowered some video cameras and saw thousands of&nbsp;crustaceans swimming in&nbsp;different directions. So&nbsp;it&nbsp;seems, they’re very unorganized.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a29/086/2896ba5ee18d3ba581e3dec322.png><p>In&nbsp;the waters of&nbsp;the Antarctic, you can also meet some of&nbsp;the scariest creatures on&nbsp;the planet. These are sea spiders. They got this name because they resemble land spiders. But they’re actually a&nbsp;species of&nbsp;marine arthropods. And unlike land spiders, those in&nbsp;the ocean are much larger. They look like 8&nbsp;strong legs without a&nbsp;body. One such spider can be&nbsp;like a&nbsp;dinner plate in&nbsp;width. Some of&nbsp;them have no&nbsp;eyes and have proboscises instead of&nbsp;jaws. Sea spiders are poorly studied because they live in&nbsp;deep cold waters.</p><p>Antarctica hides many little-known animals. There are long tunnels in&nbsp;its glaciers leading into scary darkness. On&nbsp;this cold continent, people have found the remains of&nbsp;giant dinosaurs and other ancient creatures, such as&nbsp;the ancestors of&nbsp;modern ducks. Many underground rivers and lakes hide unexplored wildlife. Even the ice here can be&nbsp;weird. Take a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;these striped icebergs! They have blue, black, green, and turquoise stripes. The color depends on&nbsp;the conditions of&nbsp;the water during freezing. For example, green lines appear because of&nbsp;algae; blue ones form when the water freezes too quickly. Okay, I’m freezing. Time to&nbsp;go&nbsp;thaw somewhere warmer.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMC1vsCnnp5lk5bDpnnWoquhZaOprqq%2B0madqK2emXqquoyapa2ZopjBqq%2FAZm9qa2Fqg3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./interdiction-des-pesticides-la-liste-des-lieux-de-vie-preserves-selargit.html><span>←</span><span>la liste des lieux de vie prservs slargit</span></a>
