In fact, <a href=# class=broken_link>if it wasn’t for&nbsp;The X Factor</a>&nbsp;we may not have ever known his name. The success of One Direction saw the boys become household names almost overnight. Surely, Harry wouldn’t need to prove his talents in another singing competition. So why did he just blind audition on&nbsp;The Voice&nbsp;last week? With his own song? In where, of all places? Watch this head-scratching audition below</strong> <strong>and decide for yourself.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j_rCkQlNxQ</p>Martinius Solum rocks harder to “Kiwi” than Harry ever did</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-no-way-harry-styles-auditioned-for-the-voice>No Way Harry Styles Auditioned For ‘The Voice’</h2><p>Harry Styles did not reminisce his&nbsp;X Factor&nbsp;glory days by entering&nbsp;The Voice Norway. But at a quick glance (and before he starts singing) contestant Martinius Solum makes you do a double-take. He played to his celebrity look-a-like by choosing to sing <a href=#>“Kiwi”</a> for his blind audition. While the eyes can quickly mistake him for Styles, his voice is distinctly different. His raw vocals give “Kiwi” more “attitude” than the original.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">KELLY CLARKSON IS NOT BACKING DOWN AS DIVORCE FROM BRANDON BLACKSTOCK GETS UGLY</a></strong></p><p>Martinius does not sound like a professional singer during his audition. An idea that had judges hesitating to turn their chairs. He seems to have potential with the proper training but could he be winning material? Three out of the four judges turned their chairs to take him under their wing.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-music-is-kind-of-martinius-forte>Music Is Kind Of Martinius Forte</h3><p>Martinius might not sound like Harry Styles belting out “Kiwi” but he isn’t tone-deaf. The judges saw potential and enough fundamentals to recognize he could develop with some mentoring. But vocals are at the bottom of his list of credits as a multi-instrumentalist.&nbsp;</p><p>On <a href=#>his Instagram</a>, he can be seen playing various instruments like guitar, keyboard, trumpet, saxophone, even a banjo. He even comments on one post that he didn’t consider himself a singer until the surprising success of his blind audition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CLheV6SJDTb/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>I guess we’ll have to follow Martinius and see how he does this season. If he sticks to the plan, we might even see him cover “Watermelon Sugar High” or “Only Angel.”&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Simon-Cowell-Contestant-Falls-Off-Stage-2.png alt="WATCH Simon Cowell In Shock After Contestant FALLS Off Stage On X Factor" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w6KbZqCRp7%2B6edKtsKWdo2K3tr%2FTZpmloZ6ZeqLBw6KroqeeYrWqv4yorqdlo6S7qHnFqKlmrJiaere7yJycaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sweet-home-netflix-ending-explained.html><span>←</span><span>Breaking Down the Epic Ending of K-Drama 'Sweet Home'</span></a>
