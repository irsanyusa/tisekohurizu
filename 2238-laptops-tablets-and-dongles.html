<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Laptops, tablets, and dongles... | YouGov</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The latest results from YouGov’s Mobile Broadband Experience (formally titled DongleTrack) reveal that the usage of mobile broadband varies considerably depending on the device.</p><p>We asked 2,552 British mobile broadband users about their usage habits, and found that tablet, tetherer, netbook and integrated laptop with mobile broadband owners are more likely to use their device on a more frequent basis than those that own dongles, modem sticks and datacards. 80% of 3G tablet owners use their device on a weekly basis compared to 60% of dongle, modem stick and datacard users.</p><p>Tablet users are also more likely to participate in a variety of internet activities, from browsing and reading e-mails to heavier activities such as streaming and downloading movies and music. In comparison, dongle, modem stick and datacard users participate in internet activities far less than tablet owners - just 11% of dongle users download or stream music and/or movies on a weekly basis compared to over a quarter (27%) of 3G tablet users.</p><p>The research also shows that data allowance and tariff costs are more important considerations for 3G tablet owners than for dongle owners. When looking at the average cost of a tariff, netbook, integrated laptops with mobile broadband and tetherer owners had an average monthly tariff value of £15.64 – a lot more than dongle, modem stick and datacard owners who spent an average monthly value of just £12.88. Similarly, 3G tablet owners paid an average of just £13.48 per month.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/dongletrack270911.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=heading>Operator satisfaction</p><p>Satisfaction rates with the operator also differ depending on the type of device owned. The research revealed that satisfaction rates are typically higher for 3G connected tablets than other devices tracked in the study. Netbook, integrated laptops with mobile broadband and tetherers all received higher satisfaction rates then dongle, modem stick and datacard owners. A halo effect (more so with Apple’s iPad) and the device’s speed capabilities explain this.</p><p>YouGov’s Mobile Broadband Experience study (formally DongleTrack) tracks consumer attitude, activity and behaviour of owners of mobile broadband devices including netbooks, laptops with integrated mobile broadband, tetherers, 3G connected tablets, dongles, modem sticks and datacards quarterly. The next wave of the tracker begins in October with a report due in November 2011.</p><p>For more information please contact <a href=#>Russell Feldman</a>, Associate Director, Technology & Telecoms Consulting</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksLC60q6knqpflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYmeAeXnLmqetp6CoerWtwaWcratdlrulecOopaCklag%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rentree-des-classes-2013-la-premiere-rentree-de-la-refondation.html><span>←</span><span>la premire rentre de la refondation</span></a>
