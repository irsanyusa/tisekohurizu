It&nbsp;might be&nbsp;some of&nbsp;your traits you’re not proud of&nbsp;and want to&nbsp;change. Or, on&nbsp;the contrary, it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;something you see as&nbsp;positive, and the reason it&nbsp;puts certain people off is&nbsp;the way they perceive you.</p><p>In&nbsp;any case, we&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> feel it’s important to&nbsp;be&nbsp;aware of&nbsp;those traits that might intimidate others. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;bonus, at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the article, we’ll also tell you what changes you can make in&nbsp;your behavior in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;maintain good relationships with your friends and colleagues.</p><p><h2>1. You’re brutally honest.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/75e/8d8/e8e2c752fcba2ab27bf71b947d.jpg><p>Honesty is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the defining characteristics of&nbsp;your personality. You like to&nbsp;be&nbsp;honest with people, even if&nbsp;it&nbsp;sometimes means telling the hard truth or&nbsp;being blunt and hurting someone. You feel that it’s the right thing to&nbsp;do, to&nbsp;speak your mind, rather than sugarcoat things or&nbsp;lie.</p><p><h2>2. You don’t like small talk.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/be6/c22/09d6755de5bc6aefed8dbbcac5.jpg><p>You don’t like wasting your time chit-chatting with people about the weather, how their weekend was, or&nbsp;any other subject people usually discuss just to&nbsp;be&nbsp;friendly and polite. Small talk seems pointless to&nbsp;you, and you’d rather get straight to&nbsp;the point and discuss things that are really important or&nbsp;have a&nbsp;meaningful conversation.</p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, you either just skip the pleasantries or&nbsp;you don’t talk at&nbsp;all to&nbsp;the people you know you won’t have an&nbsp;engaging conversation with. And that’s why you might come across as&nbsp;rude or&nbsp;cold.</p><p><h2>3. You have no&nbsp;tolerance for ignorance.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/768/d91/8a0e8e5c609c43350d15a40557.jpg><p>While you prefer to&nbsp;keep an&nbsp;open mind and like to&nbsp;learn new things, others aren’t always eager to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the same. So&nbsp;when someone gets judgmental, especially about things they aren`t really knowledgeable about, it&nbsp;can get on&nbsp;your nerves. Because of&nbsp;that, you try to&nbsp;avoid those people. Or, worst case scenario, you might lose your temper with them and become <a href=# title=emotional data-link=tag>emotional</a>.</p><p><h2>4. You can’t stand people who complain.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/636/abc/a05072595f9a8f0ddb497c5e89.jpg><p>You don’t make excuses and because of&nbsp;that don’t accept them either, and you expect others to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the same. You’d rather people pull themselves together and deal with their problems, than waste time feeling sorry for themselves. And if&nbsp;you have to&nbsp;work with those people, you feel like they’re also wasting your time.</p><p>So&nbsp;you might be&nbsp;blunt and express your opinion to&nbsp;them. Because of&nbsp;that, people might see you as&nbsp;heartless and unempathetic, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;you were a&nbsp;robot who only cares about getting results and is&nbsp;indifferent to&nbsp;the struggles they go&nbsp;through.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7f2/1fd/7bda9d5842a5d53324710972e4.jpg><p>There could also be&nbsp;certain <strong>characteristics of&nbsp;your personality</strong> that are actually nothing but <strong>positive</strong>. However, they might also be&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;intimidating by&nbsp;some people.</p><p><h2>1. You stick to&nbsp;your word.</h2></p><p>With honesty, comes the ability to&nbsp;keep your word. When you make promises, you keep them. However, not everyone can do&nbsp;that. So&nbsp;when everyone sees that your word is&nbsp;your bond, compares themselves to&nbsp;you, and sees the contrast, they might feel humiliated and powerless.</p><p><h2>2. You’re open-minded.</h2></p><p>Trying and learning new things doesn’t make you uncomfortable, unlike certain people. You’re open to&nbsp;hearing both sides of&nbsp;the story, and your decisions and opinions take them into account. You get inspired by&nbsp;the unfamiliar, which can cause you to&nbsp;start doing things differently than others. But new and strange things usually put people out of&nbsp;their comfort zone. So&nbsp;when you challenge their way of&nbsp;thinking, they might feel threatened by&nbsp;you.</p><p><h2>3. You’re strong-willed and opinionated.</h2></p><p>If&nbsp;you’re determined to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something, you will do&nbsp;it&nbsp;no&nbsp;matter what, even if&nbsp;it&nbsp;means not conforming to&nbsp;what other people are expecting of&nbsp;you. You aren’t afraid to&nbsp;go&nbsp;against the grain and stand alone if&nbsp;your way of&nbsp;thinking or&nbsp;doing things doesn’t match the norm. And if&nbsp;you can’t achieve the desired result right away, you have the confidence and faith to&nbsp;keep trying, no&nbsp;matter how pointless and strange it&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;others.</p><p><h2>Bonus: What you can do&nbsp;about&nbsp;it.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/21f/b54/6552c1586e9b85a9125d777636.jpg><p>Try to&nbsp;consider how people will feel after you tell them something with absolute honesty. If&nbsp;someone can handle the truth, go&nbsp;ahead and tell them. But some people can be&nbsp;really hurt by&nbsp;your words, and, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, it&nbsp;can damage your relationship with that person. Try to&nbsp;convey your thoughts in&nbsp;a&nbsp;truthful, but <a href=# title=respectful data-link=tag>respectful</a> manner.</p><p>For example, if&nbsp;you’re giving someone bad news, you can be&nbsp;straightforward, but also try to&nbsp;show support. Or&nbsp;if&nbsp;you have to&nbsp;criticize someone’s work, focus on&nbsp;their actions, and don’t blame their failures on&nbsp;them as&nbsp;a&nbsp;person. Show that you care about doing the work well, and give advice about what they could improve.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d2f/404/d61bb0583596afb5cb003438b5.jpg><p>Because people are so&nbsp;used to&nbsp;using small talk to&nbsp;break the ice, try not to&nbsp;just skip&nbsp;it. If&nbsp;it&nbsp;really makes you uncomfortable and you feel like you’re wasting your time, keep it&nbsp;short. It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;still worth it&nbsp;to&nbsp;make time for some friendly chit-chat so&nbsp;that people warm up&nbsp;to&nbsp;you and your further conversations can flow smoothly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/391/402/d0bdc955a3acc8fed0a207d171.jpg><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;situation where your and someone else’s views differ, try not to&nbsp;get emotional or&nbsp;offend anyone. Imagine what it’s like to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;their shoes, and choose arguments in&nbsp;support of&nbsp;your opinion that could be&nbsp;relatable to&nbsp;the people you’re in&nbsp;a&nbsp;disagreement with.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e75/b44/8428ab55439c3f7b1ff3eb89d7.jpg><p>Another thing you should keep in&nbsp;mind is&nbsp;that sometimes people just need to&nbsp;let their emotions out, even if&nbsp;it&nbsp;means looking weak by&nbsp;complaining and feeling sorry for themselves. Instead of&nbsp;criticizing them for doing&nbsp;so, try to&nbsp;show support and help them get back on&nbsp;their feet after they’ve had a&nbsp;rough time. They’ll appreciate you having their back. So&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;situation where you could have alienated someone, you made a&nbsp;friend instead.</p><p>Have you ever been in&nbsp;similar situations? How did you deal with them? What else do&nbsp;you find intimidating in&nbsp;others?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIRuv8igpaxlqaTCs3nPnqmsp56WuarA2Gakop%2BYqXqjsYyipa2hnZ6xosDIp55mrJ9ivLW0xKuqZm9pan90hI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./france-travail-la-recherche-de-la-bonne-coordination-des-acteurs-de-lemploi.html><span>←</span><span> la recherche de la bonne coordination des acteurs de lemploi</span></a>
