His story sounded like a&nbsp;real cry for help, and the man seemed just desperate. He&nbsp;found his wife’s diary and read&nbsp;it, and his actions were justified by&nbsp;the fact that she was in&nbsp;coma, and he&nbsp;wanted just some piece of&nbsp;her. But instead, he&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;totally destroyed by&nbsp;what he&nbsp;has found out about his spouse’s personality and actions.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;all started with a&nbsp;bad accident in&nbsp;the family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/054/8dc/f8334f53e79b8998d6b303ebc1.jpg><p>A&nbsp;desperate man, 39, wrote to&nbsp;us and told his absolutely devastating family story. He&nbsp;asked&nbsp;us for no&nbsp;judgement, and he&nbsp;was really hoping to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;advice from&nbsp;us and our readers about his complicated family situation.</p><p>He&nbsp;started his letter, saying, «I&nbsp;hope&nbsp;I have written to&nbsp;a&nbsp;right place to&nbsp;get some piece of&nbsp;advice. I&nbsp;can’t talk to&nbsp;anyone about this and&nbsp;I don’t think&nbsp;I will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;share my&nbsp;story with my&nbsp;closest family members.»</p><p>The man continues, saying that his beloved wife has suffered from a&nbsp;bad accident some time ago. This accident resulted in&nbsp;her being in&nbsp;an&nbsp;8-day coma. He&nbsp;explained, «When my&nbsp;spouse went into the coma, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;obvious that no&nbsp;one really knew at&nbsp;the time how long it&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;last. I&nbsp;thought that it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;months, and maybe even years, before my&nbsp;wife would ever wake&nbsp;up. I&nbsp;was not even sure if&nbsp;she actually would wake up&nbsp;from that coma, and it&nbsp;felt for me&nbsp;like&nbsp;I had lost her already.»</p><p>The man described his feelings at&nbsp;that moment, saying, «I&nbsp;was absolutely broken, I&nbsp;was destroyed with grief and all that uncertainty was killing&nbsp;me. Every day that was passing with no&nbsp;optimistic news just plunged me&nbsp;deeper into despair.»</p><p>The man also mentioned that their <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> had been always nearly ideal. He&nbsp;said, «We&nbsp;have been married for 15&nbsp;years. Together, we&nbsp;have traveled the world. I&nbsp;can say that she’s truly my&nbsp;best friend, and I&nbsp;am hers. I&nbsp;imagined that my&nbsp;life would end if&nbsp;the doctors told me&nbsp;my&nbsp;wife would become brain-dead or&nbsp;that she wouldn’t wake&nbsp;up.»</p><p><h2>The man decided to&nbsp;seek some comfort in&nbsp;reading his wife’s diary.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/506/837/e06b7550fc95526579a04fa793.jpg><p>The man revealed that he&nbsp;was totally desperate about the whole situation. One night, he&nbsp;was sitting in&nbsp;their bedroom, and he&nbsp;was feeling very bad about everything.</p><p>He&nbsp;wrote, «I&nbsp;felt emotionally and physically drained from it&nbsp;all. That was another day without optimistic news. I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;lay on&nbsp;her side of&nbsp;the bed because&nbsp;I could feel her smell from the pillows, and it&nbsp;felt comforting to&nbsp;me.»</p><p>The man said that his wife used some lotion every night before going to&nbsp;bed, and he&nbsp;opened the drawer to&nbsp;take the bottle with that lotion from there, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;smell&nbsp;it. Then he&nbsp;saw his wife’s diary there.</p><p>He&nbsp;explained, «I&nbsp;have never touched her things before, and&nbsp;I knew about the diary, but&nbsp;I never opened&nbsp;it. That night&nbsp;I just wanted some piece of&nbsp;my&nbsp;beloved, I&nbsp;was suffering a&nbsp;lot. I&nbsp;could’ve reread our old texts or&nbsp;something, but at&nbsp;that time, logical thinking wasn’t my&nbsp;strong point. I&nbsp;know it’s not a&nbsp;good excuse, but it&nbsp;is&nbsp;what it&nbsp;is.»</p><p>So, he&nbsp;started to&nbsp;read his wife’s diary. The man revealed that his wife wrote her entries days or&nbsp;months apart. Her diary was started about 4&nbsp;years ago. And while reading&nbsp;it, the man slowly felt how his hair was standing on&nbsp;end, because of&nbsp;what his beloved wife was writing in&nbsp;her diary.</p><p><h2>The man revealed another side of&nbsp;his wife’s personality.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e2c/fd3/a937fe5d78a250c997a0fd49ef.jpg><p>The man wrote, «From the start, I&nbsp;was terrified that almost all of&nbsp;the diary entries were angry ones. They were about female friends or&nbsp;social media followers. My&nbsp;beloved spouse wrote long paragraphs about how they were ugly and not talented and described their every negative trait.»</p><p>«She would become absolutely infuriated if&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman ever followed me&nbsp;on&nbsp;social media or&nbsp;if&nbsp;we&nbsp;met some female friend in&nbsp;real life. My&nbsp;wife wrote long pages about each of&nbsp;these women and how she wanted to&nbsp;see their lives destroyed.»</p><p>The man revealed that his wife turned to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very angry that he&nbsp;«had all the attention» and didn’t just delete his female followers online. She was furious if&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman followed her husband’s account and didn’t also immediately do&nbsp;the same with her account because «he&nbsp;is&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband, she must respect my&nbsp;feelings and show that she doesn’t have any intentions towards my&nbsp;man.»</p><p><h2>The man was totally shocked, and he&nbsp;also understood many things at&nbsp;once.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c0b/249/87a8b85468aae5410a0a37cfcd.jpg><p>The man revealed that, while reading his wife’s diary he&nbsp;found out that she made long rants how all women around him were actively trying to&nbsp;disrespect their marriage by&nbsp;every action they made, even the most innocent one.</p><p>He&nbsp;highlighted that all his wife’s emotions were absolutely pointless, because, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;explained, «None of&nbsp;the women she was angry about has ever written to&nbsp;me&nbsp;an&nbsp;inappropriate message, none of&nbsp;them acted in&nbsp;any other manner except a&nbsp;friendly one towards&nbsp;me. All these people were actually hometown friends or&nbsp;schoolmates.»</p><p>But the most shocking revelation was still ahead. The man revealed, «Then I&nbsp;read some of&nbsp;her notes about how she had messaged these women from secret accounts. She accused them of&nbsp;disrespecting our relationship. She wrote from anonymous accounts and said she was just a&nbsp;person from our hometown, and she would tell them offensive things and just weird <a href=# title=manipulative data-link=tag>manipulative</a> stuff. This all would result in&nbsp;the woman deleting me&nbsp;without ever telling me&nbsp;why.»</p><p>«This happened for many years, and&nbsp;I was unaware. Any new person who followed me&nbsp;and not her became immediately a&nbsp;problem, and she made sure they knew it&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way that would never throw a&nbsp;shade on&nbsp;her but still got them away from&nbsp;me.»</p><p><h2>The man doesn’t know what to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with all information that he&nbsp;discovered.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/203/c45/f4237d55aa81b4a96001aab3a8.jpg><p>We&nbsp;are very grateful to&nbsp;our reader, who has shared this very personal story with&nbsp;us. We’d advise the man to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;serious talk with his wife.</p><p>In&nbsp;his letter, he&nbsp;mentioned that she woke up&nbsp;from coma, and he’s helping her to&nbsp;fully recover at&nbsp;the moment. We&nbsp;think that when things become good in&nbsp;his family, and his wife is&nbsp;back to&nbsp;her normal life again, the man shouldn’t behave like nothing has happened.</p><p>He&nbsp;should tell his wife the truth, that he&nbsp;has seen and read her diary and that he&nbsp;knows everything about her inner problem with being so&nbsp;jealous of&nbsp;him. Probably, the couple will need a&nbsp;family counseling, too.</p><p>Everything that she does secretly from her husband, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;problem, and it&nbsp;must be&nbsp;solved by&nbsp;restoring mutual trust, openly speaking about the problems and issues that they each have and coming to&nbsp;the solution together.</p><p>And here’s yet another mind-boggling family story about a&nbsp;woman, who found a&nbsp;tampon in&nbsp;her husband’s car and ended up&nbsp;finding out a&nbsp;really <a href=#>creepy truth</a> about her spouse.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6edainZ5lp5bAbrXNZphmm5%2Birm6tzZ1komWimq6leceeqWacmZa%2FunnFqKlmm5%2Bis7C%2B02agZq%2BZqLVutYynnK%2BdomK1orCMcWhwcWBsfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nancy-pelosi-polling.html><span>←</span><span>Most Voters Want Pelosi to Leave Leadership</span></a>
