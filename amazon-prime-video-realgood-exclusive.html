Researchers found that Prime Video’s $8.99-per-month tier, which can be purchased separately from the company’s larger Prime subscription, offers subscribers 1,632 movies per dollar and 240 TV shows per dollar.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Prime Video was also the leader in quality films per dollar and high-quality films per dollar. Reelgood defines a “quality movie” as one that has an IMDb rating of 6.0 or higher and a “high-quality movie” as one with an IMDb rating of 7.5 or higher, with both requiring at least 300 votes.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">When it came to TV shows per dollar, Prime Video again came out on top, though the service was bested by Netflix Inc. when it came to the ratio of quality TV shows: Netflix’s standard pricing of $13.99 per month offers users 81 shows with an IMDb rating of 6.5 or higher per dollar.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">When it comes to original TV shows, Netflix leads the pack. Last month, 39 percent of its television programming were originals, up from 25 percent the previous year. WarnerMedia’s HBO Max was a close second, with originals accounting for 37 percent of its TV library in January. Hulu’s ad-free subscription, at $11.99 per month, came in last, with just 4 percent of its TV programming considered originals.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">A Morning Consult analysis of Netflix’s U.S. <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Top 10 list in January</a> found that 62 percent of the titles featured on the list throughout the month were Netflix original series or films.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">When looking at each service’s exclusive content -- any movie or TV episode that’s not available to stream via another subscription video on-demand service or ad-supported video on-demand service -- Walt Disney Co.’s Disney+ is the clear winner. Eighty-nine percent of the streamer’s content is exclusive, according to Reelgood, which releases a report on VOD catalogs biannually.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Netflix is close behind Disney+ at 83 percent, while HBO Max comes in third with 72 percent. Prime Video offers 38 percent exclusive content.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">More exclusive programming may lead to more subscribers. Per its last earnings report, Netflix has nearly <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>74 million paid subscribers</a> in the United States and Canada, while Disney+ has <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>nearly 87 million subscribers</a>, the company said in December. HBO Max and HBO ended 2020 with more than 41 million U.S. subscribers, according to AT&T Inc.’s <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>fourth quarter financials</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX5a6osbOp2Spqpmism7CyJ2cqGWimq6ts86om2adqJi5tr%2FIr5w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paris-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>70 Million People Shared Their Prayers for Paris on Instagram</span></a>
