When we are growing up, for some reason, our hair becomes drier and looks not so impressive. Why is this happening? How to soften natural hair?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/vllkyt4agi1ktj24t.jpeg><p class=align-left>Most of the people agree that it is the fault of shampoos. But the trichologists give out a list of factors that influence the softness of the hair. Knowing these factors, as well as some traditional recipes how to make natural hair soft can certainly help you. The soft hair can be both genetically determined and acquired, so you should pay attention to this matter. Follow these tips and you’ll get the needed result.</p><p class=h2>How to wash hair?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt7fmb9nf1l7s.jpeg><p class=align-left>Hard water is the most common version of the causes of coarse hair. Water has solutions of various salts, chlorine residues, which are used for water disinfection. They dehydrate the hair, providing the dryness and stiffness, even itching is possible. You can solve this question using a quite simple way - you can install a water filter or boil water for washing the hair - the effect is stunning. The soft water significantly reduces the consumption of shampoo; hair often does not require a balm or conditioner after washing. As hard water is a major cause of the coarse hair in 50% of cases, the proposed measures are enough.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/a457f172d1bb6cbd.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to make hand sanitizer gel or spray at home: a simple recipe</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Alternatively, you can think about such reason as wrong-chosen shampoo. Most often it is cheap variant containing parabens - the presence of this component must be mentioned on the jar. It should be replaced by a milder shampoo, you can even choose the appropriate tool in the section of children's cosmetics - products for kids always go through more strict control.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/a457f172d1bb6cbd.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Ghana weaving shuku styles</p><p class=align-left>Now there a lot of shampoos and moisturizers (masks, sprays, etc.) on sale, but you should carefully use such substances because the abundance of chemicals weakens the hair. It is necessary to choose shampoos which have vegetable-based broth, while the content of aggressive substances should be minimized in them. As for balms and conditioners, it is necessary to specify the presence of substances to soften coarse hair in their composition - lanolin, natural oils, citric acid and hyaluronic acid, vitamins A and E.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/6079a88c5badab6a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Infinix to launch most powerful gaming and entertainment smartphone ever</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Yet another important factor is the water temperature. Do not develop the habit of washing head with hot water. It is enough to adjust the temperature in the range of 40-45 ° to wash the hair. Higher temperatures lead to more thorough degreasing of the skin and hair, causing activated sebum, and make the hair get ‘oily’ faster.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt7vlhsb40m8c.jpeg><p class=align-left>The frequency of washing is important too. Most of the today's manufacturers are oriented to the production of shampoos designed for everyday use. It is clear that in this case, the manufacturer takes care of its own revenue - more product sales will provide more profits for the company.</p><p class=align-left>As for the hair, frequent washing constantly ‘washes out’ all the nutrients and at the same time it is exposed to hard water, shampoo, so it gradually loses its softness. Normally you should wash your hair at least once, in 3 days, more frequent hair washing is not allowed.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/deb96d95c9b418d5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>See how these bald-headed men are getting back their hair without stress as they give baldness a bloody nose (photos)</span></p></a><p class=h2>How to soften natural black hair without chemicals?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/6079a88c5badab6a.jpeg><ul><li>In folk medicine, if a woman wants to soften the hair she successfully uses all sorts of concoctions of herbs and plant extracts.
