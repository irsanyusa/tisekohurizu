Years, days, hours, and minutes pass constantly without&nbsp;us being able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;anything to&nbsp;stop them. And, in&nbsp;this cadence, they gradually leave their traces. We&nbsp;begin to&nbsp;grow some gray hair and our skin starts to&nbsp;wrinkle, but on&nbsp;the other hand, we&nbsp;become wiser and more appreciative of&nbsp;the important things in&nbsp;life. This happens to&nbsp;everyone, even to&nbsp;the most coveted beaus that made&nbsp;us sigh when watching <a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a> in&nbsp;the ’80s and ’90s.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> loves to&nbsp;review celebrities’ <a href=# title=careers data-link=tag>careers</a> and remember their beginnings, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;prepared this list with the before and after of&nbsp;11&nbsp;men whose showbiz industry peak happened in&nbsp;the ’80s and ’90s.</p><p><h2>1. Alec Baldwin</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/79a/222/2b0eb05eaabc9b1522c00176e3.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Alec Baldwin</a> first became popular thanks to&nbsp;the great performances he&nbsp;delivered on&nbsp;the small screen back in&nbsp;the early ’80s, when series like <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>The Doctors</i></a> were popular all over the US. But the role for which we&nbsp;probably all remember him is&nbsp;Adam in&nbsp;Tim Burton’s classic film <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Beetlejuice</i></a>. In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;being a&nbsp;full-fledged heartthrob, the actor has had a&nbsp;prolific career. He&nbsp;worked in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>A&nbsp;Star Is&nbsp;Born</i></a><i>,</i> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Pixie</i></a>, among numerous other productions that confirm he’s one of&nbsp;the greatest actors of&nbsp;our time.</p><p>But Baldwin has something that other <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> actors can’t really brag about. He’s successful not only in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;acting but also in&nbsp;his personal life. He&nbsp;has been married to&nbsp;Hilaria Baldwin for more than 20&nbsp;years and they have just welcomed their sixth child (the seventh child for Alec, who already has a&nbsp;son from his previous <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> to&nbsp;actress Kim Basinger).</p><p><h2>2. Mel Gibson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/85d/09a/06532b566bb205647da9c12a15.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Mel Gibson</a>’s professional career is&nbsp;so&nbsp;broad that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;pretty hard to&nbsp;choose just one starring role that defines him as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor. However, if&nbsp;we&nbsp;had to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it, we&nbsp;might have to&nbsp;talk about one of&nbsp;the film franchises for which he&nbsp;is&nbsp;most recognized: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Lethal Weapon</i></a>. Still, we&nbsp;think that we&nbsp;can confidently say that his most successful role came when he&nbsp;played Sir William Wallace in&nbsp;<i>Braveheart</i>. Later he&nbsp;was part of&nbsp;the cast of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>What Women Want</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Signs</i></a>,and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Force of&nbsp;Nature</i></a>.</p><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>actor</a> has been in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> with Rosalind Ross since 2014 and they have a&nbsp;son together. In&nbsp;addition, Gibson has 8&nbsp;other children from previous marriages and while he&nbsp;has had a&nbsp;less stable life than the previous actor in&nbsp;this compilation, Gibson seems to&nbsp;have found his own happy place.</p><p><h2>3. David Hasselhoff</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/05b/0c1/e0a8755b1db56b36c122c19824.jpg><p>In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;being one of&nbsp;the most handsome men in&nbsp;the industry, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>David Hasselhoff</a> turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;multifaceted person. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;7&nbsp;he began taking acting, dancing, and singing lessons, and, initially, he&nbsp;thought his path would lead to&nbsp;mostly Broadway musicals. We&nbsp;now know this was far from being true.</p><p>His role as&nbsp;Michael Knight in&nbsp;the series <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Knight Rider</i> </a><a href=# title=launched data-link=tag>launched</a> him to&nbsp;international fame. He&nbsp;was later cast in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most successful series of&nbsp;all time, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Baywatch,</i></a> and more recently in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Killing Hasselhoff</i></a>, among other productions.</p><p>You’ll hardly be&nbsp;surprised to&nbsp;learn that in&nbsp;his spare time, he&nbsp;enjoys practicing outdoor sports, like <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>scuba</a> diving. And, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;that weren’t enough for him to&nbsp;be&nbsp;perfect, he&nbsp;spends many hours visiting <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>children in&nbsp;hospitals</a> around the world.</p><p><h2>4. Kevin Costner</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/69b/8dd/4c253356ec83fbac1c0b6d6c1c.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;the man himself, it&nbsp;was pure <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>chance</a> that led him to&nbsp;become an&nbsp;actor. Let’s rewind to&nbsp;when Costner was 22&nbsp;years old <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>flying</a> back from Mexico with his new bride. On&nbsp;the same plane, all by&nbsp;himself in&nbsp;an&nbsp;empty row, sat 7-time Oscar nominee Richard Burton. The 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;them talked, Burton gave him some advice and wished him good luck, and, for Costner, that was a&nbsp;sign to&nbsp;start his career. Success came when he&nbsp;starred in&nbsp;the film <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>The Untouchables</i></a> and was part of&nbsp;the cast of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>The Bodyguard</i></a>.</p><p>But, besides movies, this actor is&nbsp;interested in&nbsp;other things. He&nbsp;acquired a&nbsp;company dedicated to&nbsp;the development of&nbsp;centrifuge machinery that helps separate <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>oil from water</a>. And not only that, but he&nbsp;also showed his <a href=# title=musical data-link=tag>musical</a> side by&nbsp;forming the band <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Kevin Costner &&nbsp;Modern West</a>, with which he’s released 5&nbsp;albums.</p><p><h2>5. Lorenzo Lamas</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e76/db6/588066538ea5f997ab7ccd857e.jpg><p>Muscular, long hair, rides a&nbsp;motorcycle... Lorenzo Lamas caught everybody’s attention when <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>appearing</a> in&nbsp;the series <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Renegade</i></a> and set a&nbsp;standard for a&nbsp;new type of&nbsp;masculinity. After appearing there, the actor was cast for <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>The Paradise Virus</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Air America</i></a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Las Vegas Vietnam: The Movie</i></a>.</p><p>Although Lorenzo is&nbsp;still connected to&nbsp;acting (he&nbsp;is&nbsp;preparing 2&nbsp;movies), he&nbsp;recently resumed a&nbsp;profession he&nbsp;had hidden, an&nbsp;airplane and helicopter pilot, and started working for the touristic flight company <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>HeliNY</a>.</p><p><h2>6. Bruce Willis</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/082/973/e165d1535384584e7e56906698.jpg><p>We’re not sure if&nbsp;you were aware of&nbsp;this, but <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Bruce Willis</a>, besides being super handsome is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the top 10&nbsp;stars in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;box office earnings. However, the story of&nbsp;his life isn’t all that simple.</p><p>His acting career started when, while working hard as&nbsp;a&nbsp;waiter in&nbsp;a&nbsp;restaurant, he&nbsp;was spotted by&nbsp;a&nbsp;director who decided to&nbsp;include him in&nbsp;a&nbsp;movie where he&nbsp;actually needed a&nbsp;waiter. But he&nbsp;was so&nbsp;skilled, that from that moment&nbsp;on, his career began to&nbsp;rise and he&nbsp;was part of&nbsp;films like <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Pulp Fiction</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Sixth Sens</i>e</a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Armageddon</i></a>, to&nbsp;name just a&nbsp;few.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, <a href=# title="Bruce Willis" data-link=tag>Bruce Willis</a> is&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship with Emma Heming but maintains an&nbsp;excellent relationship with his ex&nbsp;and mother of&nbsp;his 3&nbsp;daughters, Demi Moore.</p><p><h2>7. Matthew Broderick</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/376/49a/685fdd505ab2c24e2d8ba4f855.jpg><p>If&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Matthew Broderick</a> hadn’t injured his knee when he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;school, we&nbsp;might never have had the pleasure of&nbsp;seeing him on&nbsp;screen. It&nbsp;was only after that injury that the young man and soon-to-be star began taking acting lessons.</p><p>However, chances were high for him to&nbsp;become an&nbsp;actor, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;is&nbsp;the son of&nbsp;actor James Broderick. Today, his extensive career is&nbsp;full of&nbsp;titles that you are probably familiar with, like <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>The Cable Guy</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>The Freshman</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Addicted to&nbsp;Love</i></a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Manchester by&nbsp;the Sea</i></a>, among others.</p><p>He&nbsp;is&nbsp;married to&nbsp;Sarah Jessica Parker and they have been together for 23&nbsp;years now. “An&nbsp;actor&nbsp;I love on&nbsp;and off the stage,” the actress says jokingly when asked about her husband.</p><p><h2>8. Russell Crowe</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7e1/a52/2683fc506d8db2de16473aecbe.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Russell Crowe</a> is&nbsp;probably one of&nbsp;the most sought-after heartthrobs in&nbsp;Hollywood and one that has one of&nbsp;the most interesting careers in&nbsp;the whole industry. His path to&nbsp;success started when he&nbsp;was still a&nbsp;child. He&nbsp;jumped to&nbsp;fame after he&nbsp;became a&nbsp;star on&nbsp;Australian television. After that, he&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;2&nbsp;films, one of&nbsp;which, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>The Sum of&nbsp;Us</i></a><i>,</i> helped him break into the American scene.</p><p>From that moment&nbsp;on, his career was on&nbsp;the rise and never stopped. In&nbsp;1997&nbsp;he starred in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>L.A Confidential</i></a> alongside Kim Basinger. Then in&nbsp;2000, he&nbsp;dazzled&nbsp;us with his performance in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Gladiator,</i></a> and later he&nbsp;was part of&nbsp;the casts of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>The Mummy</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Unhinged</i></a>, among other productions.</p><p>As&nbsp;for his personal life, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>actor</a> is&nbsp;currently engaged to&nbsp;Britney Theriot and they enjoy playing <a href=# title=tennis data-link=tag>tennis</a> together.</p><p><h2>9. Emilio Estévez</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/15d/0b1/1413bf53298691cb8904bd9ee2.jpg><p>For <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Emilio Estevez</a>, the road to&nbsp;acting was a&nbsp;little smoother than for some of&nbsp;his co-stars. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;the son of&nbsp;actor Martin Sheen, who helped him a&nbsp;lot to&nbsp;get some roles and we&nbsp;can’t blame him for that, after all, Hollywood can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;difficult place to&nbsp;get around if&nbsp;you don’t know anyone there.</p><p>In&nbsp;any case, he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;wait until he&nbsp;was 18&nbsp;years old (when he&nbsp;finished his studies) to&nbsp;officially start his career. He&nbsp;started with a&nbsp;few side roles, like in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Tex</i></a>, but it&nbsp;was in&nbsp;1983 when he&nbsp;made his leap to&nbsp;fame with the film <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>The Breakfast Club</i></a>. Among his latest films are <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>The L.A. Riot Spectacular</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>The Public</i></a>.</p><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>actor</a> was married to&nbsp;Paula Abdul, but after they split&nbsp;up, he&nbsp;has kept a&nbsp;very low profile and has not been seen with another partner, or&nbsp;at&nbsp;least not publicly.</p><p><h2>10. Michael J. Fox</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/761/56d/d1fc5a5d70a4efc8f4d07de37c.jpg><p>It’s very likely that, just like&nbsp;us, you also would have liked to&nbsp;jump in&nbsp;Michael J. Fox’s car to&nbsp;travel through time with him and check out what secrets the future holds for all of&nbsp;us. <i>Back to&nbsp;the Future</i> was one of&nbsp;his most iconic movies, but he&nbsp;has also <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>appeared</a> in&nbsp;many other important movies and series, like <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Tales from the Crypt</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Annie</i></a><i>,</i> and most recently in&nbsp;Netflix’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>See You Yesterday</i></a>.</p><p>Currently, the actor is&nbsp;going through a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;a&nbsp;rough patch. He’s facing health problems, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;suffers from Parkinson’s, a&nbsp;disease he&nbsp;was diagnosed with several years ago. However, he&nbsp;has not lost his optimism and spends his time with his wife and children. “The last few years have been the most difficult. But I&nbsp;have things I’ve been blessed with, which are just amazing. Life is&nbsp;good,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p><h2>11. Tom Cruise</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7fc/fce/f6e62951e7bec2b124199c69d6.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you were a&nbsp;teenager in&nbsp;the ’80s either you (or&nbsp;one of&nbsp;your friends) had to&nbsp;have had a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Tom Cruise</a> poster hanging in&nbsp;your room. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;very difficult to&nbsp;summarize the career of&nbsp;this heartthrob in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few lines since it’s full of&nbsp;different experiments, movies, series, etc. However, if&nbsp;we&nbsp;had to&nbsp;choose just a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;them, we&nbsp;can confidently say we&nbsp;will always remember him for his role in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Top Gun</i></a> and the action franchise <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Mission: Impossible</i></a>.</p><p>Recently <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Cruise</a> finished shooting a&nbsp;sequel for one of&nbsp;his most famous movies, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Top Gun: Maverick</i></a>. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;also busy shooting <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>Mission: Impossible 7</i></a>&nbsp;and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>8</i></a>. And it&nbsp;seems that with these projects he&nbsp;has also found love, because he&nbsp;is&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship with his co-star in&nbsp;the movie, British actress Hayley Atwell, at&nbsp;the moment.</p><p>Who was your favorite actor or&nbsp;actress of&nbsp;the ’80s and ’90s?
