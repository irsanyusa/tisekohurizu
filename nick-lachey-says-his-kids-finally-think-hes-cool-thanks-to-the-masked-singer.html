He shared that the couple’s children will ask him to stop singing around the house. As Vanessa said, he responds by telling them, “My singing put a roof over our heads.”</p><p>Nick shared that his kids were finally interested in his career when he appeared on The Masked Singer as Piglet and won the show. He joked, “It took dressing up like a pig and singing on national television to be cool to my kids.
