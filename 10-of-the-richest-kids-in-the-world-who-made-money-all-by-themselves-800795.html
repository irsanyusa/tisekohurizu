From YouTubers to&nbsp;gamers to&nbsp;bow-tie company owners, these kids became rich by&nbsp;choosing to&nbsp;never give&nbsp;up. With a&nbsp;pinch of&nbsp;desire and good luck&nbsp;— and, of&nbsp;course, a&nbsp;little help from their parents&nbsp;— they were able to&nbsp;pass the challenges that followed.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> chose a&nbsp;few successful kids to&nbsp;learn more about, and once you read their stories, you may start asking your kids for business ideas.</p><p><h2>1. Ryan Kaji</h2></p><p>A&nbsp;few years ago, Ryan, who was a&nbsp;preschooler at&nbsp;the time, loved watching <a href=# title=YouTube data-link=tag>YouTube</a> videos about toy reviews, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;asked his parents to&nbsp;make him a&nbsp;channel. They agreed, but no&nbsp;one was watching the videos at&nbsp;first. However, his mom got an&nbsp;idea that brought her son success. She filmed him in&nbsp;a&nbsp;video playing with more than 100 toys from the Pixar series, <a href=#>Cars</a>, and it&nbsp;went viral.</p><p>Today, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;9&nbsp;years old and one of&nbsp;the highest-paid YouTubers, <a href=#>making</a> nearly $30&nbsp;million. But 2020 isn’t the only year he&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;onto the list of&nbsp;highest-paid YouTubers&nbsp;— he&nbsp;earned big bucks in&nbsp;2018 and 2019&nbsp;as well.</p><p><h2>2. Nastya</h2></p><p>Anastasia Radzinskaya, who’s also known as&nbsp;Nastya on&nbsp;the <a href=#>Internet</a>, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;kid YouTuber. She was born in&nbsp;Russia and was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. The doctors, at&nbsp;that time, were worried that she might never be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;speak.</p><p>In&nbsp;2015, her <a href=#>parents</a> decided to&nbsp;test their luck and took a&nbsp;leap of&nbsp;faith, selling their companies just to&nbsp;create and invest in&nbsp;the Like Nastya channel. Starting with filming her unboxing toys, Nastya now has lots of&nbsp;different kid-friendly content online with over 190.6 million subscribers on&nbsp;YouTube. In&nbsp;fact, she earned an&nbsp;impressive $18.5 million in&nbsp;2020.</p><p><h2>3. Matthew David Morris</h2></p><p>Known as&nbsp;MattyBRaps or&nbsp;MattyB, Matthew David Morris started his <a href=#>journey</a> to&nbsp;success when he&nbsp;began posting music videos on&nbsp;YouTube but as&nbsp;remixes from the original ones. The very first one he&nbsp;made was a&nbsp;cover of&nbsp;Justin Bieber’s “Eenie Meenie” when he&nbsp;was just 7&nbsp;years old in&nbsp;2010. In&nbsp;4&nbsp;years, his channel had a&nbsp;billion views.</p><p>It’s estimated that he’s <a href=#>worth</a> $3&nbsp;million, which he&nbsp;made through song purchases, ad&nbsp;revenue, and personal appearances.</p><p><h2>4. Moziah Bridges</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c13/7fb/e406b05dc7b935653462dd49cd.jpg><p>When Moziah Bridges was just a&nbsp;little <a href=#>boy</a>, he&nbsp;loved to&nbsp;dress&nbsp;up. He&nbsp;even wore 3-piece suits when he&nbsp;was on&nbsp;the playground. However, he&nbsp;hated the bow ties that were sold in&nbsp;stores, so&nbsp;when he&nbsp;was just&nbsp;9, he&nbsp;created a&nbsp;company to&nbsp;solve the problem.</p><p>Actually, when he&nbsp;got the idea, he&nbsp;got help from his grandmother who is&nbsp;a&nbsp;former seamstress. She taught him how to&nbsp;sew. With some additional help from his mom, he&nbsp;reached his goal. Now he&nbsp;makes bow ties, neckties, and other accessories with prices ranging anywhere from $15 to&nbsp;$50. In&nbsp;about 6&nbsp;years, the company has sold products worth more than $600,000 in&nbsp;total.</p><p><h2>5. Alina Morse</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/009/36b/77bded5bd2a4ada320c96b4baf.jpg><p>Alina found her sugar-free candy company when she was only&nbsp;9, simply because her father told her that she shouldn’t eat candy because it&nbsp;would ruin her teeth. So&nbsp;she started learning and experimenting with sugar-free candy recipes by&nbsp;watching YouTube videos.</p><p>When she was 13-years old, she started her Zolli Candy company right out of&nbsp;her home kitchen, and in&nbsp;2018, she made $6&nbsp;million! Alina <a href=#>was</a> able to&nbsp;prepare for meetings with retailers around the world and manage 6&nbsp;employees all in-between dance practices and middle school classes. Her company became “number one” at&nbsp;selling sugar-free candy.</p><p><h2>6. Nick D’Aloisio</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e25/246/08bb8759039a040476a2e0c561.jpg><p>Nick D’Aloisio taught himself how to&nbsp;write software when he&nbsp;was 12. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;15, he&nbsp;built a&nbsp;free iPhone <a href=#>app</a> called Summly. This app automatically summarizes news stories, which is&nbsp;great for small screens. Later, when he&nbsp;was&nbsp;17, he&nbsp;sold his app to&nbsp;Yahoo! Inc. for nearly $20&nbsp;million. After the deal took place, the app was eventually taken down, but it&nbsp;had already been downloaded almost 1&nbsp;million times.</p><p><h2>7. Kyle Giersdorf</h2></p><p>At&nbsp;only 16&nbsp;years old, Kyle <a href=#>became</a> an&nbsp;instant millionaire when he&nbsp;won the Fortnite World Cup that was held in&nbsp;New York. He&nbsp;won $1.8 million of&nbsp;the $3&nbsp;million prize pool. Before his success, he&nbsp;was just another boy who was looking for <a href=#>inspiration</a> through streaming channels. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;way, this helped him to&nbsp;evolve as&nbsp;a&nbsp;gamer.</p><p><h2>8. Evan</h2></p><p>Evan’s story started when he&nbsp;was just 5&nbsp;<a href=#>years old</a>. Together with his father, Evan created a&nbsp;stop motion recording with some Angry Birds toys. He&nbsp;just wanted to&nbsp;show off the video to&nbsp;his family and friends but it&nbsp;turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;entertaining for more people than he&nbsp;expected.</p><p>By&nbsp;2015, he&nbsp;had millions of&nbsp;views and made <a href=#>about</a> $1.3 million per year. Today, Evan and his family have 5&nbsp;YouTube channels, collectively.</p><p><h2>9. Farrhad Acidwalla</h2></p><p>Farrhad is&nbsp;now 27&nbsp;years old but has been an&nbsp;entrepreneur for more than a&nbsp;decade now. It&nbsp;all started <a href=#>when</a> he&nbsp;was just 13&nbsp;years old. He&nbsp;borrowed $10 from his parents to&nbsp;start an&nbsp;online community about aero-modeling and aviation. After some time, he&nbsp;sold his project to&nbsp;a&nbsp;fan for about $1,200.</p><p>A&nbsp;few years later, when he&nbsp;was&nbsp;16, he&nbsp;used $400 to&nbsp;start his own business (Rockstah Media), which focuses on&nbsp;branding, advertising, and web development. Today, his net worth is&nbsp;<a href=#>estimated</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;$4&nbsp;million.</p><p><h2>10. Isabella Barrett</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/01e/2c1/b580ce5028b13bfac093dc4a0f.jpg><p>Starting her career on&nbsp;TLC’s Toddlers &&nbsp;Tiaras, she <a href=#>became</a> a&nbsp;self-made millionaire by&nbsp;the time she was 6&nbsp;years old. Now she’s a&nbsp;teenager and owns 5&nbsp;brands. Se&nbsp;also dresses many of&nbsp;the top teen celebrities.</p><p>When she was asked what drives her these days, she said she gets motivated when seeing other teens and kids who do&nbsp;even bigger things than she does.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you know someone who’s trying to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;career out of&nbsp;gaming or&nbsp;YouTube? What’s your child’s dream?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5xec6fZK2glWK%2Fqq%2FHnqqtZZuesbR5yKdkraCVYsSwvsudZLCgn2K6orDEZqSoppWueqK4y2aZsmWknbKuv8SlrZ6rXW19cYOYbmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./black-panther-star-dorothy-steel-dies-amid-filming-sequel.html><span>←</span><span>'Black Panther' star Dorothy Steel dies amid filming sequel</span></a>
