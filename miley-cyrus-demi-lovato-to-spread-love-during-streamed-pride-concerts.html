Both artists are scheduled to host separate Pride events today for different streaming platforms. <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> is set to headline the <a href=#>Stand By You</a> pride concert streaming exclusively on NBC’s Peacock network. <a href=#>Demi Lovato, </a>on the other hand, is hosting YouTube Pride Party 2021 alongside a number of additional hosts. Both openly queer artists advocate heavily for the LGBTQ+ community.</strong></p><p>So far, it looks like there is much to anticipate from both events. The different viewing platforms will surely affect the experience for viewers, though both events are for a great cause. Either way, the entertainment factor does not seem to be lacking on either side of the fence.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cyrus-hippie-vibes-rock-the-nashville-stage>Cyrus’ Hippie Vibes Rock the Nashville Stage</h2><p>Cyrus will be serving happy hippie vibes and all things nice as she takes the stage at Nashville’s iconic Ryman Auditorium. She will perform a number of her biggest hits including “The Climb” and “Party in The USA.” Covers from artists such as Cher, Cyndi Lauper, and Madonna will also be heard. Friday’s performance is also set to feature guest stars like Brother’s Osbourne, Mickey Guyton, Little Big Town, and Orville Peck.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’ve got a lot of guests. A lot of #Pride. AND A LOT OF WARDROBE CHANGES Don’t miss my #MileyPrideSpecial June 25th @peacocktv,” Cyrus wrote in an Instagram post announcing the new special. “Coming to your home from my hometown Nashville, TN! We brought A LOT of LOVE into the legendary @theryman – See you there!”</p><p>While the concert seems nothing short of fabulous, The Peacock Network is a subscription-based streaming service. As it is also a newer platform, the accessibility of the content to fans is highly limited. Lovato’s pride party on the other hand can be easily reached by viewers on YouTube.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lovato-s-star-packed-youtube-showdown>Lovato’s Star Packed YouTube Showdown</h2><p>Lovato, alongside Olly Alexander and Mawaan Rizwan, will join hosts Trixie Mattel and Daniel Howell for the show. The ongoing livestream event will celebrate the LGBTQ+ community from each host’s respective YouTube channels. Musical performances, games, and challenges will all take place at the pride party. Viewers are encouraged to donate to <a href=# class=broken_link>The Trevor Project</a>.</p><p>Lovato recently announced they are <a href=#>non-binary </a>and uses they/them pronouns. They have joked that they are “too queer” to marry a man right now and are still exploring their sexuality.&nbsp;</p><p>“I feel that this best represents the fluidity I feel in my gender expression, and allows me to feel most authentic and true to the person I both know I am and still am discovering,” Lovato said in an instagram video.&nbsp;</p><p>Lovato is known for being open and honest with her fans and encourages fans to live unapologetically. Producers of YouTube Pride 2021 are also asking content creators to share their stories. Questions for the hosts will also be answered during the event.&nbsp;</p><p>So which event will you be tuning into? Or will you be watching both? Whether you’re a Miley or Demi stan, you can’t go wrong with all the love being spread through our screens.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Thumbnail_PhotoByStephenJCohen-JamesDevaney_GettyImages.jpg alt="Pitbull Turns Country in Collab with Luke Bryan, Trace Adkins" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zKKjnrFdmMazwdJmm56lmWK5sMLAraZmrJ9iwLG%2BxJqbZqSfq7JusNSroKefXajBs7HAppydZaCntqWxjJymp5uVp8G0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./crescent-city-review-1236108404.html><span>←</span><span>Crescent City Review: Overplotted Thriller Sustains Interest Primarily with Yeoman Perfo</span></a>
