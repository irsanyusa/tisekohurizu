The 20-year-old stopped by the set to reunite with his coach Blake Shelton. He offered up some great advice for the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 21</a> artists as they prepared for their Blind Auditions.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cam-anthony-stops-by-the-voice-blind-auditions>Cam Anthony Stops By ‘The Voice’ Blind Auditions</h2><p>Shelton looked so happy to see Cam back on The Voice. They chatted about Cam’s recent appearance on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>. He also shared that he has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">been in the music studio</a> and is “ready to get some music out.” While we are all patiently waiting to hear some originals from Cam, it was cool to see him interact with people who are in the same position that he was in.</p><p>Cam met with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peedy Chavis</a> backstage as he was preparing for his performance of Elvis Presley’s “Heartbreak Hotel.” Cam’s advice seemed to work because Peedy was able to turn Shelton and John Legend’s chairs with his Blind Audition. He ended up choosing to be on Team Blake, just like Cam did during his audition last season.</p><p>“Blinds are nerve-racking but just center yourself and prepare yourself for the rollercoaster that you’re about to go on because the next step from here is going to be crazy,” Cam said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/ReUPtHBfeXI</p></figure><p>He also told contestant <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Katherine Ann Mohler</a> that “life is about to change.” Katherine performed “We Don’t Have to Take Our Clothes Off” for her Blind Audition. She ended up choosing to be on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ariana Grande’s team</a>. Cam got to meet Grande backstage and pose for photos with the coaches.</p><p>“It’s lit. Ariana Grande is a coach and you know it’s really dope to have her here,” Cam said. “She’s going to bring something really interesting to the show.”</p><p>We hope Cam will be brought back again at The Voice finale to perform. He dominated Season 20 with his performances and distinct tone. Even Grande is a huge fan of his. She had nothing but good things to say about him after meeting him for the first time.</p><p>“He’s the coolest person I’ve ever met,” Grande said.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Benson-Boone-American-Idol-Imagine-Dragons-What-Happened-To-Benson-Boone-scaled-e1633540703642.jpg alt="Benson Boone Signs Huge Record Deal After Quitting ‘American Idol’ Season 19" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570p6YrKeeYn9xedOhnGaun56wpnnWoqWnnaJisKK5jJqlraCfo8ZuuMSarZ6rXZa%2Fqq3NmmSgqpGjsaZ50q2Yq6ukp8Kkt44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stanley-kubrick-shining-taschen-book-lee-unkrich-1235556874.html><span>←</span><span>How a New Book Unearths the Secrets of The Shining, from Stanley Kubrick-Shelley Duvall</span></a>
