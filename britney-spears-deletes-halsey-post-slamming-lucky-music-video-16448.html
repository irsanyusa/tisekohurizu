That was not me on my phone !!! I love Halsey and that’s why I deleted it !!!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p dir=ltr lang=en>Fake news !!!

On social media, she responded to a fan asking if she’d gotten permission, “Yes, of course! I wouldn’t even dream of doing it without her blessing!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Spears lashed out at Halsey because of the video, inspired by the original “Lucky” music video storyline that being a pop star is not all it seems.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“For obvious reasons I’m very upset about the Halsey video,” wrote Spears. “I feel harassed, violated and bullied. I didn’t know an artist like her and someone I looked up to and admired would illustrate me in such an ignorant way by tailoring me as a superficial pop star with no heart or concern at all. I have my own health problems which is why I took down my IG account yesterday. I will definitely be putting it back up now to show I CARE. I’m speaking with my lawyers today to see what can be done on this matter. It feels illegal and down right cruel.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Halsey’s video follows the duality of a young girl idolizing Halsey, who, behind the scenes, is struggling with her relationship and health. The video shows her getting infusions and removing her wig to reveal a shaved head, which she references in the lyrics.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I shaved my head four times because I wanted to and then I did it one more time cause I got sick,” Halsey sings. “I thought I changed so much nobody would notice shit, and no one did. Then I left the doctor’s office full of tears / Became a single mom at my premiere / I told everybody I was fine for a whole damn year, and that’s the biggest lie of my career.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Lucky” is expected to be a part of Halsey’s upcoming, fifth studio album — her first since 2021’s Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross-produced “If I Can’t Have Love, I Want Power.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-26-at-4.36.56-PM.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpWPDor7InquyZpOkunB%2Bj2traKWlqLake82erqxnkqe2tbrEsmSsqJWWv7R5w56jnqyVqHqprcusnLJloKTAtXnSpZimpZmjtG641JyismWdqsCqr4yvoJ2dn2J%2Bd4CTcWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./royal-family-and-wales.html><span>←</span><span> | Wales.com</span></a>
