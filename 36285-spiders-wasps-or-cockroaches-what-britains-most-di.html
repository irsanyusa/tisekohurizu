New YouGov data shows that our eight-legged cohabitants top the list as Britain’s most disliked creepy-crawly, with one in five people (22%) listing them as the minibeast they have the strongest negative feelings towards.</p><p>It’s a close race, however. Another fifth of Britons (19%) dislike wasps the most, while about the same number of people (18%) have similar feelings about cockroaches.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/worst_insect-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>While mosquitos cause <a href=#>more human deaths</a> than any other animal group, they don’t quite attract the same level of public dismay as spiders, wasps and cockroaches. But at 11%, they still come fourth as Britain’s most disliked pest.</p><p>Flies (4%), earwigs (4%) and moths (3%) make for more niche choices. The list of creatures was drawn up from an open question on a previous survey asking people to write in their least favourite minibeast. The top 10 most commonly mentioned wrigglers were selected for this question.</p><h3>Women hate spiders, men hate wasps</h3><p>One in four women (26%) dislike spiders the most of any insect, bug or creepy-crawly, compared with one in six men (17%). Meanwhile, the most popular answer among men is wasps at 21%. Around one in six women (16%) share their opinion.</p><p>Men are also slightly more likely than women to say mosquitos are top of their list at 13% vs 9%.</p><p>However, men are more than twice as likely as women to insist they don’t dislike any of the insects, bugs and creepy-crawlies included in the survey, with one in eight (12%) saying this is the case, compared with one in twenty women (5%).</p><p>There is also some divide across age groups. Among younger Britons aged 18 to 34, 30-31% say spiders are the miniature monstrosities they hate the most, compared with only 13% of Britons aged 65+.</p><p>The most common answer among older Britons is cockroaches, at 23%, compared to only 10% of 18-24 year olds.</p><p><strong>See the full results <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnY2t%2FeYGMrKeinJWnwG7DwKynrGWfp3qku8KkqaiZk52ytHnWoZitZZKntrWtyKeqZqWfqMFusMg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1608227-nigerian-woman-cries-husband-leaves-kitchen-total-mess-cooking-spaghetti.html><span>←</span><span>Nigerian Woman Cries Out as Husband Leaves Kitchen in Total Mess after Cooking Spaghetti</span></a>
