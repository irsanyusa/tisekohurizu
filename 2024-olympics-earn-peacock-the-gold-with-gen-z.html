Plus, a look at Gen Zers’ shifting political ideology.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>🥇 Peacock gets the gold 🥇</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Look out Simone Biles, there’s a new star emerging from the 2024 Olympics: Peacock.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">NBC has long been the destination for all things Olympics, but this year its streaming service, specifically its new “Gold Zone” offering, is being <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>hailed as “addictive”</a> and applauded by viewers on social media. It’s also translating to huge usage numbers for Peacock. According to NBC Sports, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>usage of Peacock for the Paris Olympics</a> through just the first several days of the Games had already surpassed the combined total of the full Beijing and Tokyo Olympics. Paris streaming minutes are up 25% over those previous Games combined.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">It also looks to be winning over a coveted consumer group: Gen Z, who have kept executives up at night over their relative <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>lack of interest in sports</a>.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Key brand metrics for Peacock are all up double digits among the digitally-native generation compared with July 2021, the month the 2020 Olympics premiered. For example, 56% of Gen Zers said Peacock was a “good value” in July 2024, a whopping 26 percentage point increase from July 2021.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“Gold Zone'' isn't the only feature that’s leading to a more engaged Gen Z audience. Peacock invested heavily in influencer partnerships, bringing on one of Gen Z’s favorite podcasters for its Olympic coverage, Alex Cooper. The “Call Her Daddy” host, and former college soccer player, is anchoring a live-streamed show on Peacock called "Watch with Alex Cooper.” If Peacock continues to deliver a high quality product with media personalities beloved by the generation, it's sure to secure Gen Z viewership well beyond the 2024 Olympics.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">▶️ To learn more about Morning Consult Intelligence, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>request a demo here</a>.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">▶️ For more streaming trends, check out our <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>media and entertainment tracker here.</a>&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>🤔 Gen Z: The moderate generation? 🤔</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Ahead of the 2024 presidential election, Gen Z’s political ideology looks to be moderating.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">As of June 2024, Gen Z adults are nearly just as likely to identify as political moderates (27%) as the average U.S. adult (29%). That’s up six percentage points from the 21% of Gen Zers who said the same in January 2021. Simultaneously, the share of liberal-identifying Gen Z adults dropped from 41% to 29%, and the share of self-described conservatives grew from 16% to 21%.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">It’s very likely that liberal identification among Gen Z adults experienced a surge in early 2021 in the wake of the January 6th insurrection and President Biden’s inauguration. Even so, it continued to decline well after that news cycle had moved on.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The bottom line is this: More and more Gen Zers are moving toward the political middle, at the most detriment to liberalism. And while the chart above shows data collected among all Gen Z adults, this trend also holds true for Gen Zers who are registered to vote.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">▶️ For more data on Gen Z’s political ideology, read <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>our latest memo here</a>.
