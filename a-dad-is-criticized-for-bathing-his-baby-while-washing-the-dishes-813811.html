In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;providing for the little one, parents are faced with the constant balance between caring for the baby and household chores. That’s why, many times, they resort to&nbsp;creative solutions.

She even has a&nbsp;sponge that she plays with during the bath.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f69/267/57fc6056f58075be4f2baf5401.jpg><p>What caught the attention of&nbsp;users was not so&nbsp;much the fact of&nbsp;bathing the baby in&nbsp;the sink but that the father used the same water to&nbsp;rinse the dirty dishes he&nbsp;was washing. It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;seen how Martín takes the dishes out of&nbsp;the sink and rinses them again while the baby continues to&nbsp;sit and play, even putting her hands in&nbsp;her mouth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0d7/8d5/11e4fb550e95e2d92208369381.jpg><p>Some Internet users criticized the father and accused him of&nbsp;being irresponsible with his daughter. “The sink is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the places with the highest amount of&nbsp;bacteria” or&nbsp;“Poor children who are born in&nbsp;irresponsible homes and their parents risk their babies for a&nbsp;simple like.” Others think it’s a&nbsp;great idea: “Oh, my&nbsp;heart melts when&nbsp;I see the baby, and how fun that the dad can do&nbsp;two things at&nbsp;the same time,” commented one woman.</p><p>“When Mom’s not home, but you’re an&nbsp;experienced Dad.”</p><p>This situation generated controversy and divided opinions on&nbsp;social networks, with comments ranging from support or&nbsp;judgment of&nbsp;the <a href=#>father for his action</a> to&nbsp;concern for the baby’s health. To&nbsp;what extent is&nbsp;it&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;multitask?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5usMCdZKKrXZi%2FqsDInKCznZRis7C%2BjJuYraCZo7RutMisZJuZkq56uLTIpZxmr5Gotaq6xmaroZ1dmba0tMSsZHFpY21%2Bcns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lifestyle-16-of-the-most-iconic-outfits-from-90s-movies.html><span>←</span><span>16 of the most iconic outfits from '90s movies</span></a>
