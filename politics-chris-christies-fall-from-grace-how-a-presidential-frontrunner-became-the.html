Over the next two decades, he would lobby for large energy companies and help fundraise for George W. Bush's presidential campaign.</p><p>In 2001, Bush named Christie US Attorney for the District of New Jersey despite his limited experience in politics.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Christie ran for governor of New Jersey in 2009 and beat his Democratic competitor with 49% of the vote, compared to incumbent Jon Corzine who secured 44.5%.</p><p>A staunch Republican, Christie has cut employee pension funds, publicly decried abortion, and supported giving state money to fund private religious schools.</p><p>Source: , , and</p><p>Christie has also used aggressive rhetoric against unions challenging employee cuts. The national teachers union deserves "a public slap in the face," Christie once said on CNN.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>While Christie's response to scandals such as Bridgegate helped damage his approval rates, he was still reelected for a second term in 2013.</p><p>One of the biggest scandals in Christie's career occurred when, in 2013, two lanes in the New York-New Jersey George Washington Bridge were ordered closed during the peak of morning rushing hour. A later investigation found that Christie's office ordered the closures to "get back" at a Democratic mayor who did not support Christie's reelection.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Two of Christie's senior officials were sentenced to prison for their role in the ordeal. Christie was not criminally charged in the scandal and rebuffed calls to resign.</p><p>In mid-2015, Christie surprised both parties by announcing he would run for president of the United States. He dropped out after a poor showing in the New Hampshire primary.</p><p>Days later, Christie endorsed former Republican rival Donald Trump and lost even more favor with his constituents after making multiple public appearances by Trump's side.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Source: and</p><p>Even though Trump initially named Christie as the head of his transition team, he eventually dropped the governor in favor of his running mate, Mike Pence.</p><p>Even among Republicans, Christie's popularity hit a historic low. By June 2017, only 15% of New Jersey residents approved of the governor's performance.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>On July 3, 2017, photos emerged of Christie sunbathing at a state beach with his family after it had been closed to the public due to the state's failure to pass a budget. "I didn't get any sun today," Christie told reporters at a later press conference.</p><p>Coupled with Christie's already declining approval rates, the most recent beach scandal led many to question whether the New Jersey governor had simply given up on trying to represent the people he serves.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7z6ijoqyZmMBwvM6loK2hk6h6pLTRoqpmm5intrTAyJ6qZp6RoblustGopGafopawpnnHqK5mmV2lv6a%2FyJ2cp6yZlrlustGopa2qpaO7pr6Mm5ycmZ2aerW0xGhosaqTZsd5</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-dreamers-life.html><span>←</span><span>As DACA Deadline Passes, a Portrait of a Dreamer's Life</span></a>
