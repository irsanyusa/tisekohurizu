She expressed that the situation was quite confusing considering the fact that they were on the same team for the therapy sessions group. She said, "She started acting out, she was being feisty, and I was even rubbing her leg saying calm down... I don't understand this drama".</p><p>Since Kimoprah and Lucy aren't from the same BBNaija season, it is unclear where this present feud could have brewed from. However, <strong>Pere</strong> and <strong>Mercy</strong> spoke to Lucy in other to try and calm her down. They shared some of their experiences in the All Stars house so far and they implored her to try to shake things off.</p><p>Big Brother didn't immediately act on Lucy's request to leave the house as he asked that the conversation be moved to a later time. Lucy is still in the <a href=# id=0c9ec5ee-e8c6-427a-a265-689a67a3d008 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>BBNaija All Stars</a> house as of August 22, 2023, and only time will tell if she stays till the very end.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mpq%2Bhlah8r7HWZp%2BoraOauqLAxGajrpupYr%2BmvdSeqq2rXau8rcHNrZirsV2axarAjJ%2BpqKVdl6%2BvrcijmGaZnKF6tMDAq6pospabhq%2BE0g%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dodo-recipes-how-to-prepare-plantain-and-goat-meat-peppersoup.html><span>←</span><span>How to prepare plantain and goat meat peppersoup</span></a>
