Since 2015, Lawrence has been the highest-paid actress in the world, and her films have grossed over $5.5 billion worldwide. She appeared in Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2013 and Forbes Celebrity 100 the following year and in 2016.<p>Lawrence made her film debut with a supporting role in Garden Party (2008), and had her breakthrough playing a poverty-stricken teenager in the independent drama Winter's Bone (2010). She achieved wider recognition for playing the mutant Mystique in X-Men: First Class (2011), a role she reprised in later installments of the series.</p><p>Lawrence's fame continued to grow with her starring role as Katniss Everdeen in the Hunger Games film series (2012–2015), which established her as the highest-grossing action heroine of all time. She went on to earn various accolades from her collaborations with director David O. Russell. Her performance as a depressed widow in the romance film Silver Linings Playbook (2012) received an Academy Award for Best Actress, making her the second youngest Best Actress Oscar winner.<br>Lawrence is known in the media for being a vocal advocate of feminism and gender equality, and is the founder of the Jennifer Lawrence Foundation through which she supports various charitable organizations.</p>Personal life: While filming X-Men: First Class in 2010, Lawrence began a romantic relationship with her co-star Nicholas Hoult. Following a brief split in 2013, the couple broke up during X-Men: Days of Future Past in 2014. Lawrence is a supporter of Planned Parenthood, asserting that attacking the organization is "an attack on women". She is a feminist, a concept she argues should not intimidate people "because it just means equality". She promotes body positivity among women.<p>The review website IndieWire, in 2012, described Lawrence's personality as "down-to-earth, self-deprecating, [and] unaffected". She is frequently referred to as "America's Sweetheart" in the media. An IGN writer considers her to be a "sharp", "funny" and "quirky" actress who likes to "stay grounded" despite considerable success. Lawrence says that she finds acting "stupid" and does not believe in being "cocky" about her success. As a role model to young people, she tries to be careful with her words.</p>Net Worth:<h3>Jennifer Lawrence Net Worth: $<span id=Total>100 Million</span></h3><b>Jennifer Lawrence's Income / Salary:</b><br><b>Per Year:</b> $<span id=Year>20 Million</span><p><b>Per Month:</b> $<span id=Month>2 Million</span></p><p><b>Per Week:</b> $<span id=Week>500,000</span></p><table style=width:100%><tbody><tr><td><b>Per Day:</b></td><td><b>Per Hour:</b></td><td><b>Per Minute:</b></td><td><b>Per Second:</b></td></tr><tr><td>$<span id=Day>70,000</span></td><td>$<span id=Hour>3,000</span></td><td>$<span id=Minute>50</span></td><td>$<span id=Second>1.00</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br>Since you arrived on this page at <span id=CurrentTime></span>Jennifer Lawrence Earned: <span id=earnNow></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmwp6KptW%2B6xK1ma2hhbHxxgY6hprBlnaqwqXnMqKWesV2ZvKa%2FjKOcp6aZm7Kzecuarqudnpiyb7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sante-et-securite-au-travail-annick-girardin-devoile-un-plan-daction.html><span>←</span><span>Annick Girardin dvoile un plan d'action</span></a>
