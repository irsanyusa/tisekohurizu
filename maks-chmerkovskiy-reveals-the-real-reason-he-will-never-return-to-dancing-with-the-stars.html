In an interview, Chmerkovskiy candidly stated that he has no intentions of returning to DWTS in any capacity, not even as a guest judge.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-maks-chmerkovskiy-confirms-that-he-s-not-returning-to-dwts>Maks Chmerkovskiy Confirms That He’s Not Returning to DWTS</h2><p>Longtime fans of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dancing With The Stars</a> will remember Chmerkovskiy’s run from seasons 2-5, 7-14, All Stars, 18, and 23-24. Since he was a longtime competitor on the series, many are dying to know if he’d return to the ballroom in any capacity. While discussing the series recently, Chmerkovskiy expressed his fondness for the show’s original format.</p><p>The pro dancer mentioned that the show has undergone changes over the years, but he holds a deep attachment to its roots. While he won’t be physically involved in future seasons, he said that he’ll always be part of the show in a supportive role, given his familial connections to it. For those who may not know, both Chmerkovskiy’s wife, Peta Murgatroyd, and brother, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Val Chmerkovskiy</a>, are currently competing on Season 32.</p><p>While he firmly maintains that he won’t participate physically in the show anymore, he acknowledges the show’s evolution. He believes that it has grown and adapted, and he appreciates that transformation. “I don’t have any plans for physical participation,” he stated, adding that he thinks the show has also moved on with him, and he “loves that.”</p><p>Despite his decision to part ways with DWTS, Chmerkovskiy isn’t bidding farewell to reality television altogether. He is set to participate in Season 2 of The Traitors, which is expected to air on Peacock in 2024.</p><p>The dance professional had a noteworthy stint on DWTS, participating in 17 seasons and winning the Mirrorball Trophy with his Season 18 partner, Olympic figure skater Meryl Davis. He had previously expressed an interest in joining the judges’ panel on a regular basis or even hosting the show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-maks-chmerkovskiy-launches-a-new-skin-care-business>Maks Chmerkovskiy Launches a New Skin Care Business</h2><p>Following his departure from DWTS, Chmerkovskiy is now making moves in the world of skincare. Teaming up with his wife and fellow DWTS professional, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peta Murgatroyd</a>, they have introduced a new platform known as the “Maks & Peta Marketplace.” This marketplace offers a range of vegan and cruelty-free skincare products, from Foot Spray to CBD Pain Cream and Hand & Foot Lotion.</p><p>What sets this venture apart is its commitment to giving back. A portion of the profits from Maks & Peta Marketplace will support Baranova27, a 501c3 nonprofit organization dedicated to assisting individuals affected by the war in Ukraine. As a Ukrainian himself, Chmerkovskiy recognizes the importance of using his platform for the greater good.</p><p>In addition to their skincare initiative, Chmerkovskiy recently launched a premium vodka named Tetya Kapa. This exclusive vodka is available for purchase on napadistillery.com, with only a limited number of bottles produced, priced at $55.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_Beyonce_TaylorSwift_John-Shearer_Getty-Images-for-TAS-220x147.jpg alt="Beyoncé Attends Taylor Swift’s ‘Eras Tour’ Movie Premiere" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJqirGWTnbqmvsqorayjma56s7HVnpilq12ptaZ50Z6YpWWimq60u81mn55lp565rXnNnq2eql2nsrXB0adkraddma6vr8innmavmam1bsDHnmSsrJGnwHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-xander-berkeley-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Money Does Xander Berkeley Make?
