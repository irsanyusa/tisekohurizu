That includes the crown of thorns — believed by some to have been worn by Jesus during his crucifixion — and the tunic of St. Louis. Some works will be moved to the Louvre, where they are expected to be repaired or restored, if necessary.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Firefighters and other emergency responders formed a human chain to save the crown of thorns and other relics from the Notre Dame fire, Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo said. Jean-Marc Fournier, chaplain of Paris’s fire brigade, joined the chain and entered the building to save what holy relics he could, according to local media.</p><p lang=fr dir=ltr>Merci aux <a href=#>@PompiersParis</a>, aux policiers et aux agents municipaux qui ont réalisé ce soir une formidable chaîne humaine pour sauver les œuvres de <a href=#>#NotreDame</a>. La couronne d'épines, la tunique de Saint Louis et plusieurs autres œuvres majeures sont à présent en lieu sûr. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/cbrGWCbL2N</a></p>— Anne Hidalgo (@Anne_Hidalgo) <a href=#>April 15, 2019</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The cause of the blaze remains unclear; Notre Dame has been undergoing an <a href=#>extensive restoration process</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here are the works of art and artifacts that were saved, lost or destroyed in the Notre Dame fire:</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What was saved</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Among the most treasured artifacts that were saved include the Holy Crown of Thorns, a wreath of thorns believed to have been placed on Jesus Christ’s head during his crucifixion, and the tunic of St. Louis, believed to have belonged to Louis IX, who was king of France from 1226-1270. Notre Dame’s famed bell towers also survived the fire.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Also thought to be safe is Notre Dame’s grand organ. Paris Deputy Mayor Emmanuel Gregoire said the organ, which has about 8,000 pipes and dates back to the 1730s, was still intact following the fire. However, Culture Minister Riester said during a news conference Tuesday that the organ was “quite affected” by the fire. While the instrument may be intact, it’s unclear whether it sustained water damage as the blaze was extinguished.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The rose windows — three large stained glass windows for which Notre Dame is famous — appear to have survived the fire as well. The Archbishop of Paris told local news outlet <a href=# rel=noopener>BFM TV</a> that the rose windows remain intact. Riester said Tuesday that the windows are faring well. “The large rose windows don’t appear to have suffered catastrophic damage,” he said.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What was lost</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The first immediate loss in the Notre Dame fire came when the cathedral’s iconic spire collapsed after being overtaken by flames. The fire also destroyed the cathedral’s roof.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The extent of the damage to other artwork and relics housed inside the cathedral is still unknown. Riester said some of the greatest paintings inside Notre Dame will be removed starting on Friday.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We assume they have not been damaged by the fire, but there will eventually be damage from the smoke,” he said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The fate of other relics stored in the cathedral, like a piece of wood and a nail thought to have been involved in Jesus’ crucifixion, are unknown.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubWdmgnV%2BjqemraqVYrGiucRmnaKqlWKus8CMmqmtoZaWsLW%2FjKWmrKxf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./48477-may-2024-election-most-palatable-to-public.html><span>←</span><span>May 2024 election most palatable to public</span></a>
