Since this couple has quickly become one of our favorites from American Idol, let’s relive each moment of their sweet relationship.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-david-foster-katharine-mcphee-s-relationship-timeline>David Foster, Katharine McPhee’s Relationship Timeline</h2><p>David Foster and Katharine McPhee recently recalled first meeting on American Idol season 5 (2006). Foster and Andrea Bocelli were guest mentors for the contestants, so that’s how they met. They reportedly became friends then went on to work together. Foster even produced McPhee’s first single! From there, the couple went on to appear at charity events and tour together.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>The couple was first spotted together as a couple in 2017 when they got cozy in Malibu. At the time, a source revealed that McPhee and Foster are “so sweet together.” Even though there’s a 34 year age difference between the two, their love knows no age. The couple began their relationship as Foster was finalizing his divorce with Yolanda Hadid and McPhee had ended her two year relationship with Elyes Gabel. Once word was out about their relationship, they appeared on many red carpets together. By July 2018, Foster and McPhee were engaged.</p><p>Almost a year later, the couple tied the knot in London in an initiate ceremony. Soon after they tied the knot, Foster gushed about McPhee, <a href=#>saying</a> “she’s really magical and able to float in and out of all the family dynamics. It’s amazing to watch because that’s a huge talent — being able to navigate my life.”</p><p>In October 2020, the couple shared that they were expecting their first child. McPhee announced that they were expecting by publicly turning down Aperol Spritz. Even though she didn’t openly say “I’m pregnant,” she hinted at it, saying “I won’t be drinking this anytime soon, wink, wink.”</p><p>The couple welcomed their first child, Rennie David Foster, in February 2021. Later that year, the duo appeared together as part of The Masked Singer season six. Together, they portrayed <a href=#>Banana Split</a>.</p><p>Earlier this year, Foster clapped back at haters that commented on their age difference. At the time, he acknowledged that an age gap is something that can “bring a marriage down,” but they have it figured out. Since then, this couple has not refrained from showing their love off to the world. They’ve continued to post countless photos of their love. Recently, McPhee posted a photo of her and Foster making out in their backyard.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/SaraJames_AveryDixon_LilyMeola.png alt="All 6 Golden Buzzer Auditions on ‘America’s Got Talent’ Season 17" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>David Foster</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>katharine mcphee</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w5qtopxdm7y0wMSrZKSZpJ2us7XNnmSmm6Cdsqa%2FjKucpZmknryvv8eip2asmaKyrbXNnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bruxelles-adopte-des-nouvelles-regles-pour-les-aides-aux-energies-renouvelables.html><span>←</span><span>Bruxelles adopte des nouvelles rgles pour les aides aux nergies renouvelables</span></a>
