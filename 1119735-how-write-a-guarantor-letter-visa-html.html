Most of the time, it concerns people who do not have the money to pay for their trip themselves, or employees on a business trip to a foreign country.</p><p class=align-left>In the first case, people who do not have a stable income (if any) can ask their family members or friends to be their guarantors. In the second case, some employers might send their employees to foreign countries on business trips. As employees usually do not have to pay for it out of their own pockets, their employer acts as a guarantor.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/1e0b0029d23f5024.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best advice and samples of how to write a resignation letter</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Guarantors can either be from the traveller’s country of origin or from the country of their destination.

In some countries, guarantor also guarantees that the other person will leave the foreign country as soon as their visa expires. Alternatively, the guarantor should be able to cover any expenses, if the other person fails to leave the foreign country.</p><p class=align-left>Every country has its own rules for guarantors.
