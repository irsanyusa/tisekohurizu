There are optional subjects chosen by&nbsp;the teacher like robotics, tricks and circus art, theater, choreography, or&nbsp;veterinary studies.</li><li><strong>In&nbsp;senior high school, students choose the direction of&nbsp;their education by&nbsp;themselves. </strong>They can study foreign languages, chemistry, physics, biology, music, biotechnology, design, theater, criminology, psychology, economics, etc. Also, it’s possible to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;tourist service or&nbsp;accounting certificate together with a&nbsp;school diploma.</li></ul><p><h2>Japan</h2></p><ul><li><strong>In&nbsp;primary school kids <a href=#>study</a></strong> the Japanese language (not only in&nbsp;the modern form, but also medieval and ancient), calligraphy, poetry, arithmetic, nature studies, social studies (ethics, history, etiquette), music, visual arts, physical education, and household.</li><li><b>In&nbsp;secondary school, they get additional subjects </b>like&nbsp;IT, natural sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, geology combined together), life safety fundamentals, history, English (with a&nbsp;native speaker), and several special optional subjects.</li><li><b>In&nbsp;senior high school, </b>apart from the previous subjects, they have 2&nbsp;specializations: either humanitarian or&nbsp;natural sciences. The main goal of&nbsp;studying is&nbsp;getting into university which is&nbsp;why pupils choose the rest of&nbsp;the subjects by&nbsp;themselves. For example, it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;agriculture, industry, commerce, fishing, medical training, welfare, foreign languages, and so&nbsp;on.</li></ul><p><h2>Saudi Arabia</h2></p><ul><li>The <a href=#>compulsory</a> subjects at&nbsp;Saudi Arabian schools include lessons in&nbsp;religion, mathematics, and natural sciences (biology, physics). But, humanitarian sciences like history or&nbsp;social studies are almost nonexistent in&nbsp;private schools.</li></ul><p><h2>Ireland</h2></p><ul><li><strong>There are only 2&nbsp;compulsory subjects:</strong> English and mathematics (some schools have an&nbsp;additional third compulsory subject&nbsp;— the Irish language).</li><li><strong>The rest is&nbsp;<a href=#>optional</a>. </strong>Pupils take examinations on&nbsp;the subjects that they are planning to&nbsp;connect their lives with. The choice is&nbsp;quite big&nbsp;— there are 34&nbsp;available subjects. For example, accounting, business organization, management, music, drawing, household, IT, woodworking, foreign languages, agriculture, theater, music, and a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;dozen other disciplines.</li></ul><p><h2>Australia</h2></p><ul><li><strong>In&nbsp;primary <a href=#>school</a></strong>, apart from basic subjects like arithmetic, native language, physical education, the environment, and creative lessons, kids are taught to&nbsp;give public speeches.</li><li><b>In&nbsp;secondary school, </b>English, mathematics, the theory of&nbsp;probability, computer literacy, social studies, history, geography, ecology, art (dance, drama, music, and drawing), physical training and science (including chemistry, physics, and astronomy) are compulsory.</li><li><b>In&nbsp;senior high school, </b>pupils study the basics of&nbsp;their future profession and are introduced to&nbsp;subjects like accounting, IT, economics, etc. —&nbsp;the choices are extensive. Moreover, those who study in&nbsp;the 11th-12th grades get access to&nbsp;internship programs in&nbsp;working companies. And right after graduation exams, they have an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;get an&nbsp;entry-level job.</li></ul><p>There is&nbsp;an&nbsp;interesting idiosyncrasy regarding&nbsp;PE lessons&nbsp;— usually, there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;gym in&nbsp;schools and lessons are held outside. If&nbsp;the weather is&nbsp;rainy, lessons get canceled. <strong>The students of&nbsp;senior level classes can take surfing lessons if&nbsp;their schools are located not far from the ocean.</strong></p><p><h2>Spain</h2></p><ul><li><strong>Primary <a href=#>education</a></strong> includes the Spanish language, literature, nature studies, physical education, mathematics, a&nbsp;foreign language, and an&nbsp;art subject, which is&nbsp;usually music that is&nbsp;taught at&nbsp;a&nbsp;high level. By&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;school, kids can play some musical instrument. Usually, it’s the flute because it’s easy to&nbsp;carry&nbsp;it.</li><li><b>In&nbsp;secondary school, they get additional </b>social sciences, geography, history, graphics and plastic arts, music and technology (the last 3&nbsp;can be&nbsp;studied for one year each).</li><li><b>In&nbsp;senior level classes,</b> each pupil gets 3&nbsp;extra subjects in&nbsp;one direction. There are a&nbsp;total of&nbsp;4&nbsp;directions:</li></ul><li>Humanitarian sciences</li><li>Technology</li><li>Natural sciences</li><li>Art</li><p><h2>China</h2></p><ul><li><strong>Compulsory subjects in&nbsp;primary school are </strong>mathematics, Chinese, a&nbsp;foreign language, and optional drawing, music, or&nbsp;physical education.</li><li><b>At&nbsp;the secondary and senior levels,</b> they get additional science (physics, chemistry, and biology combined together), social studies, computer skills, and computer science. The level of&nbsp;complexity, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;basic subjects, increases year by&nbsp;year, making Chinese schools one of&nbsp;the most difficult and psychologically pressing educational systems. By&nbsp;the way, we&nbsp;have an&nbsp;article about&nbsp;it.</li></ul><p><h2>Great Britain</h2></p><ul><li><strong>In&nbsp;primary school, kids <a href=#>study</a> </strong>English<strong>, </strong>mathematics, history, geography, music, industrial technology, and art. The final list of&nbsp;subjects is&nbsp;formed by&nbsp;the parents.</li><li><b>Later they get additional subjects </b>like the basis of&nbsp;religion (they study ethics and views of&nbsp;all religions), geography, natural science, computer science, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;numerous subjects that are chosen by&nbsp;students&nbsp;— for example, cooking, music, psychology, photography, dancing, drama, law, social security, accounting, art and design,<strong> science of&nbsp;the sea</strong>, travel and tourism, and so&nbsp;on.</li></ul><p><h2>Russia</h2></p><ul><li><strong>In&nbsp;primary school, </strong>kids study mathematics, nature studies, the Russian language, reading, a&nbsp;foreign language, drawing, music, physical education, and <a href=#>chess</a> (an&nbsp;option that has appeared in&nbsp;many schools since 2018).</li><li><b>The curriculum of&nbsp;the secondary school looks like this: </b>the Russian language and literature, a&nbsp;foreign language, algebra, geometry, informatics, history, social science, geography, natural history, biology, physics, chemistry, life safety fundamentals, physical education, handcrafts.</li><li><b>In&nbsp;senior high school,</b> students get mechanical drawing, astronomy, and world art culture. In&nbsp;many schools, the 10th and 11th classes are divided into 4&nbsp;specializations: humanitarian, technological, mathematical and social-economical. The amount of&nbsp;lessons on&nbsp;compulsory subjects is&nbsp;reconsidered in&nbsp;these classes. For example, a&nbsp;mathematical class will have more lessons in&nbsp;mathematics and physics, while there will be&nbsp;fewer literature lessons.</li></ul><p>The system of&nbsp;education in&nbsp;Russia is&nbsp;unified&nbsp;— there are no&nbsp;personal curriculums available for pupils. However, there are schools and regions with additional subjects. For example, there are lessons of&nbsp;the native language and literature in&nbsp;the regions with another major nation. In&nbsp;some regions like Bashkortostan, where there are very unusual classes like <strong>beekeeping.</strong></p><p>Which subjects do&nbsp;pupils study in&nbsp;the schools of&nbsp;your region?
