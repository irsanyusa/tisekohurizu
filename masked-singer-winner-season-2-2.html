And after the Flamingo (who placed third) was revealed to be Adrienne Bailon from The Real and The Cheetah Girls, and the Rottweiler (who placed second) was revealed to be singer Chris Daughtry the Fox was unmasked last.</p><p>Watch his SHOCKING reveal below!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p>The Fox is revealed on The Masked Singer Finale</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Fox is…<strong>Wayne Brady!</strong></h2><p>Just as we <a href=#>predicted</a>, the Fox was Wayne Brady. All the clues lined up perfectly to be him and you just can’t mistake that showmanship and voice. But the main clues that drove us to think it was Wayne Brady were all the nods to improv, Whose Line Is It Anyway?, his multiple Emmy awards, and his daughter. And in the end, we were right! (And I was right in <a href=#>guessing he’d win the Golden Mask</a>!)</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OePThci7YZQ</p>Fox performing “Tennessee Whiskey” by Chris Stapleton on The Masked Singer</figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>The Fox’s Best Moments on The Masked Singer Season 2</h4><p>The Fox brought his A-game all season with great performances every time he took the stage. My personal favorite performance from the Fox was “Tennessee Whiskey” because we finally got to hear him sing a stripped down song. There were no frills so he had a chance to shine. I really think that performance is what sealed his place in the Finale too. Leading up to it, this song made him stand out among the rest of the singers left.</p><p>But on the other hand, I also loved <a href=#>“Hey Look Ma, I Made It!”</a> The upbeat songs were his strongest asset throughout the competition because he just had so much fun with them. He really dominated both sides of the competition, bring charisma and an amazing voice, which led to him becoming The Masked Singer winner! And, in my opinion, he deserved it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p>The Masked Singer recap show and winner prediction after the Semifinals</figure><p>Congratulations to Wayne Brady on the big win and the Golden Mask!
