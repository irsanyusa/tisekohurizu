You cannot talk about the Ijaw struggle without the Opobo, the Bonny, and the Kalabari.</p><p>“We had our trade lines at that time and for you to occupy a trade line, it means you are a true Ijaw man. So, for the records, I am a full-blooded, up to my bones, an Ijaw man.”</p><p>Highlighting the qualities that distinguished the ethnic group, the Governor said the Ijaw people are bold, courageous, and forthright people who, despite being subjected to inhuman treatment, did not succumb to being traded as slaves during the slave trade.</p><p>He condoled the Kalabari people over the demise of their monarch, late <strong>King Theophilus J.T. Princewill</strong>, assuring them of his government's readiness to participate in the burial activities.</p><p>Fubara also urged the Kalabari people to set aside their differences and work together to give the late king a befitting burial.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>For his part, the regent of the Kalabari kingdom, <strong>Dr Charles Princewill</strong>, said the purpose of the visit to the Government House was to notify the governor of the demise of Theophilus J.T.
