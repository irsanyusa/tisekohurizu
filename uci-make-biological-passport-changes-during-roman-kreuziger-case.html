So what we've decided to do is look at all of these cases and treat them, if we can, as the equivalent to being an A-sample positive test.</p><p>"So rather than these things going on and on for months and months with riders competing, we will look at each case very carefully and if we believe there is sufficient evidence to pursue a case we will in all likelihood put a provisional suspension, as if we would had it be a positive A sample."</p><p>Cookson insisted that the UCI's decision was justified, revealing there were some serious doubts about Kreuziger's biological passport.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"There are very serious anomalies," the 63-year-old Briton said.</p><p>"The UCI and CADF experts have a very strong indication of manipulation.</p><p>"He has been invited to submit explanations. They've been submitted and they're not found to be convincing and we are now in a situation where we would have had to take disciplinary action very soon and we've done that as quickly as we could."</p><p>Kreuziger joined Tinkoff-Saxo in 2013 after two seasons with Astana, following four years on the books at Liquigas, who are now known as Cannondale.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdktKq%2F02isnKFdoq6ssYyboKikn5y2pK3LZqeaq6OlvLPAjJyfmqaXmsBusNSroKefXae8rq3NZqKrnaWvtqix0WaamquVZH6st9Gzrao%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./storm-debby-threaten-northeast-flooding.html><span>←</span><span>Remnants of Debby Threaten the Northeast With Flooding</span></a>
