<a href=../../../medical-debt-may-be-removed-from-credit-reports.html></a>
Medical bills may soon be banned from credit reports under a new rule proposed Tuesday by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).&nbsp;
While lenders have been restricted from obtaining or using medical information in their credit decisions under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, exceptions in federal legislation allowed lenders to continue doing so. The proposed change would effectively close that loophole by barring credit reporting companies from disclosing medical debts to lenders, and prevent lenders from using that debt to make lending decisions.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Mr. Porky Pork Scratchings popularity &amp;amp; fame</h2><time>Aug 20, 2024</time>

Some world records may be&nbsp;impossible for&nbsp;us to&nbsp;break. After all, not all of&nbsp;us can train like Usain Bolt and can run a&nbsp;100-meter dash in&nbsp;just 9.58&nbsp;seconds. Not everything is&nbsp;beyond our reach though, as&nbsp;there are some achievements that we&nbsp;might actually succeed in&nbsp;beating, even if&nbsp;we’re just in&nbsp;the comfort of&nbsp;our own homes.
Bright Side found these feats that we&nbsp;can try to&nbsp;beat, just for fun.

You’re shopping at&nbsp;your favorite mall, and it’s time to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;the next level. You notice the escalator stopped moving, so&nbsp;it’s probably broken. You can choose to&nbsp;walk on&nbsp;it&nbsp;anyway or&nbsp;look for the stairs or&nbsp;an&nbsp;elevator. So, what it’s going to&nbsp;be? If&nbsp;you chose option&nbsp;A and bravely stepped on&nbsp;a&nbsp;stopped escalator, I&nbsp;have some bad news for you. You’re putting yourself at&nbsp;risk since the escalator isn’t designed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;used as&nbsp;regular stairs.

Argentina is a fascinating and diverse country. It boasts stunning natural landscapes: from the flat grassland of the pampas to the dramatic Andes mountains in the West to the deserts of Patagonia. Argentina’s cultural heritage is also rich and well-known, with images of the Argentine tango, the gauchos (cowboys), and the asada (barbecue)—likely springing to mind.&nbsp;
