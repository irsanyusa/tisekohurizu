There was an increased threat of tornadoes and flooding along the path including the busy I-95 corridor, said Jon Porter, Accuweather’s chief meteorologist.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There will be multiple threats in Debby’s final chapter, and it’s a dangerous one,” Porter said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Vermont Gov. Phil Scott warned of serious damage in the state, including&nbsp;<a href=#>already drenched parts of Vermont</a>&nbsp;that were hit by&nbsp;<a href=#>flash flooding</a>&nbsp;twice last month. Flooding that slammed the northeastern part of the state&nbsp;<a href=#>on July 30</a>&nbsp;knocked out bridges, destroyed and damaged homes, and washed away roads in the rural town of Lyndon. It came three weeks after deadly flooding from the remnants of&nbsp;<a href=#>Hurricane Beryl</a>. President Joe Biden approved Vermont’s emergency declaration.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Vermont amended its state of emergency to ensure access to additional help, including vehicles from the National Guard and rescue boats from neighboring states, the governor said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Debby&nbsp;<a href=#>was downgraded to a tropical depression</a>&nbsp;late Thursday afternoon, and was a post-tropical cyclone on Friday, the National Hurricane Center said. It made landfall&nbsp;<a href=#>early Monday</a>&nbsp;on the Gulf Coast of Florida as a Category 1 hurricane. Then, Debby made a second landfall early Thursday in South Carolina as a tropical storm.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">By 11 a.m. Friday, Debby was centered between Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Albany, New York, moving northeast at a rapid 37 mph (59 kph), the National Hurricane Center said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At least eight people have died related to Debby. The latest was identified as Hilda Windsor Jones, a 78-year-old woman who was home alone when a tree fell during the storm Thursday night, splitting open her mobile home in North Carolina, the Rockingham County Sheriff’s Office said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stormwater swamped parts of downtown Annapolis, Maryland, including at the U.S. Naval Academy campus Friday. And flash flooding hit the South Carolina town of Moncks Corner, where one of Debby’s early bands unleashed a tornado on Tuesday.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Up to 3 feet (0.9 meters) of fast-moving water rushed into Monks Corner, a city about 30 miles (48 kilometers) from Charleston, the National Weather Service said. Across the surrounding Berkeley County, emergency crews made 33 high water rescues.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In North Carolina, first responders went door-to-door urging people to evacuate from a neighborhood in the town of Haw River, where the river was expected to crest Friday afternoon. The town is about 60 miles (97 kilometers) northwest of Raleigh.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To the north, Vermonters were making ready for the storm.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Rick Dente, who owns Dente’s Market in Barre, Vermont, worked to protect his business with plastic and sandbags as the rain poured down on Friday. “There isn’t a whole lot else you can do,” he said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Jaqi Kincaid, hit by floods twice in Lyndonville, Vermont, said the previous storms knocked out her garage, felled a 120-foot (36-meter) tree and took down fencing. “We’re doing a lot of this,” she told a reporter, holding her hands together as if in prayer.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">___</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sharp reported from Portland, Maine.
