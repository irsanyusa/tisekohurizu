<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Best T-shirts for Women: 16 Versatile Options to Add to Your Wardrobe</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>I have a few perennial quests in my life because I always wonder if there’s something better out there that I missed. The perfect T-shirt is one of them. A simple garment, the T-shirt has been around for a long time—in fact, Hanes started making their white T-shirts in the early 1900s.</p><p>Today, pretty much every brand or label has their own version, or two. There are cropped ones, long ones, boxy ones, slim ones, relaxed ones, and more. While there are some great <a rel=alternate href=#>places to order custom T-shirts online</a>, we stuck to solid colored ones (with the exception of one striped) without writing, logos, or images for this list.</p><p>To help you wade through all the options, we compiled this guide to the best T-shirts available in a variety of categories. No matter what style you’re looking for, you’re sure to find something that will fit the bill.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-t-shirts-for-women>What to consider when buying T-shirts for women</h2><p>There’s a big difference between shopping for a classic white T-shirt that can be dressed up or down, to shopping for a workout shirt. To help with that, consider the following:</p><h3>Necklines</h3><p>Crew neck, V-neck, or boat neck: they all offer something. A crew will provide a classic, timeless look while a V-neck adds an elongating detail to your neckline (excellent for making you look a bit taller). Boat necks are great for those with small breasts or pear-shaped bodies.</p><h3>Materials</h3><p>Gone are the days where you had to shop for men’s T-shirts in order to find a quality option (especially for white tees). Most of the T-shirts on this list are made from 100% cotton, with a handful being cotton and modal blends. Cotton is a breathable, durable fabric that comes in a variety of weights. I will always love plain old white cotton Hanes T-shirts, they’re the most suitable in my opinion.</p><h3>Fit and shape</h3><p>T-shirts come in a variety of fits and shapes including, slim, classic, relaxed, and oversized. Having some in every shape is the way to go. Slim T-shirts are ideal for dressing up or when you want to show off your shape. A classic shape paired with jeans or a skirt creates a stylish, timeless look and a ‘just-right’ oversized fit gives off some vintage vibes.</p><h2 id=our-picks-for-the-best-t-shirts-for-women>Our picks for the best T-shirts for women</h2><h3>Most popular T-shirt for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Amazon Essential Classic Fit Short Sleeve T</a></h3><p>Made with just a bit of stretch, the Amazon Essentials Short Sleeve T-shirt is a versatile wardrobe piece at a very attractive price. It’s nothing fancy; just a classic crew neck tee with a close, but not tight fit. Pair it with jeans and white sneakers for a casual, go anywhere look. At $19 for two, you can afford to get some in each of the vast range of available colors.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Sizes: XS-XXL</li><li>Colors: Black, white, and many more</li><li>Materials: 56% cotton, 38% modal, 6% spandex</li><li>Fit: Classic</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Many colors</li><li>Great price point at $19 for pack of 2</li><li>Classic fit; neither too tight nor too loose</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some may not appreciate the added stretch</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This is a basic crew neck T-shirt with a classic fit at an affordable price.</p><p><span class=best-for>Most popular T-shirt for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Amazon Essentials Women's Classic-Fit Short-Sleeve Crewneck T-Shirt, Pack of 2, White, X-Large</h3></p><h3>Best varsity T-shirt for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Faherty Cloud Cotton Varsity Tee</a></h3><p>As a 70s child, I’m always a sucker for an old school varsity T-shirt. This one from Faherty is cut from a super soft cotton, modal blend with drop shoulders for a relaxed, vintage look. I especially love the faded dusty rose color and stripe details. Pair this with <a rel=alternate href=#>leggings</a> or jeans for a go-to casual outfit.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Sizes: XXS-XXL</li><li>Colors: White, dry rose</li><li>Materials: 60% Pima cotton, 40% modal</li><li>Fit: Relaxed</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Extremely soft</li><li>Vintage feel</li><li>Great dusty rose color</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Expensive at $85</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>These are an old school, relaxed fit vintage feel varsity T-shirt made from a soft, drapey cotton, modal blend.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best varsity T-shirt for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Faherty Cloud Cotton Varsity Tee</h3></p><h3>Best oversized T-shirt for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Redone Hanes Oversized T</a></h3><p>Made from recycled and organic cotton, this Hanes T-shirt from Redone is the perfect balance between oversized and flattering. Redone’s partnership with Hanes consists of reverse engineering the “perfect, vintage inspired, recycled cotton from a 1970s T-shirt.” As someone who was a kid in the 1970s wearing all manner of Hanes T-shirts, I can say that they’ve pretty much nailed it.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Sizes: XS-L</li><li>Colors: White, black</li><li>Materials: 50% recycled cotton, 50% cotton</li><li>Fit: Oversized</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Made from recycled and organic cotton</li><li>Vintage, 1970s inspired</li><li>Perfect oversized fit</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Expensive at $125</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This shirt is made from vintage inspired, recycled cotton with an iconic Hanes silhouette.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best oversized T-shirt for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Redone Hanes Oversized T</h3></p><h3>Best value T-shirt for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Hanes Perfect-T</a></h3><p>The brand name Hanes is pretty much synonymous with T-shirts. They’ve been making them since the early 1920s, so it’s no surprise that their aptly called “Perfect” T-shirt would end up on a list of best T-shirts. Simple, classic, with no extra frills, the Perfect T features a slim, long silhouette made from U.S. grown cotton with a ribbed crew neckline.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Sizes: S-3XL</li><li>Colors: Blue, forest, red, black, grey, white, and more</li><li>Materials: 100% ring spun cotton</li><li>Fit: Slim</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Made from 100% U.S. grown cotton</li><li>Durable and sturdy</li><li>Tearaway tags</li><li>Wide color selection</li><li>Very affordable at $13, on sale $9</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Shrinks a bit after first washing</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This is a simple, classic, and durable option made of 100% cotton from one of the most recognized brands in T-shirts.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best value T-shirt for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Hanes Women's Perfect-T Short Sleeve Cotton Crewneck T-Shirt</h3></p><h3>Best lightweight T-shirt for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Madewell Whisper Cotton T</a></h3><p>Cut from a light, slub, cotton jersey, this T-shirt from Madewell has vintage vibes and a lived-in softness that will likely make it one of your go-to tees. The curved hem is hip length and the relaxed cotton shape is neither too tight nor too loose. The fabric is lightweight for warm days or layering.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Sizes: XXS-3X</li><li>Colors: White, black, heather gray</li><li>Materials: 100% cotton</li><li>Fit: Relaxed</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Wide size range</li><li>Soft and drapey</li><li>Curved hem</li><li>Great price at $19.50</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Doesn’t always hold up well through washings</li><li>A bit on the sheer side</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>It has a thin, relaxed-fit and a vintage-feel with a curved hem at a great price.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best lightweight T-shirt for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Madewell Whisper Cotton Crewneck T-Shirt in Optic White at Nordstrom, Size Medium</h3></p><h3>Best V-neck T-shirt for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Hanes X-Temp V-neck T</a></h3><p>Made with X-Temp technology, this Hanes V-neck T-shirt adapts to your body temperature throughout the day, meaning it helps keep you cool when the thermometer rises.

(Think of it as an even more comfortable alternative to a classic button down shirt.) The semi-fitted shape means it’s not too tight, too boxy, too long, or too short; it’s just what the name says: timeless. We only wish it came in more colors.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Sizes: XXS-XXL</li><li>Colors: Grey, white, rose, black</li><li>Materials: 60% cotton, 40% modal</li><li>Fit: Semi-fitted</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Perfect semi-fitted shape</li><li>High quality fabric</li><li>Silky, soft feel</li><li>Great price at $25</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Only available in 4 colors</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>The Timeless T is not too tight, or too loose and can go from dressy to casual with ease.</p><p><span class=best-for>Most comfortable T-shirt for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Timeless T-Shirt</h3></p><h3>Best boxy T-shirt for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Quince Cotton Modal crew neck</a></h3><p>I recently discovered these Quince T-shirts while on a quest to replace an old favorite from another brand that had been discontinued. I wanted something soft and drapey with a relaxed fit for wearing around the house or with super casual outfits. The Quince cotton modal T-shirt checked all these boxes, plus, it costs significantly less than comparable ones from designer brands. I own several of these, in a variety of colors. In fact, I just bought some more as I was researching for this article and discovered they were on sale for $15 each.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Sizes: XS-XL</li><li>Colors: Dark gray, sienna, olive, black, white, blue, and others</li><li>Materials: 50% cotton, 50% modal</li><li>Fit: Relaxed with scoop neckline</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Soft fabric</li><li>Roomy, drapey fit</li><li>High quality</li><li>They’re normally $48, on sale for $15</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>A bit expensive when not on sale</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>It’s a high quality basic T-shirt made from cotton and modal for a soft, drapey, comfortable look.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best boxy T-shirt for women</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.quince.com/5TI6mHFgsZtNEodoIv6NVn/51e7e72e57609498aee61138daddb444/W-LKT-2-DGRY_0479.jpg alt="Quince Cotton Modal crew neck" title="Quince Cotton Modal crew neck" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Quince Cotton Modal crew neck</h3></p><h3>Best long-sleeve T-shirt for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>J.
