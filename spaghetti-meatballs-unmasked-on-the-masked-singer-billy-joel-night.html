At the end of the night, Spaghetti & Meatballs was unmasked as MasterChef star Joe Bastianich.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-spaghetti-amp-meatballs-unmasked-on-the-masked-singer>Spaghetti & Meatballs Unmasked on The Masked Singer</h2><p>During Wednesday’s show, Spaghetti & Meatballs performed “Only the Good Die Young” by Billy Joel, showing off an impressive voice. However, there was some tough competition in this week’s episode, so Spaghetti & Meatballs was in the bottom two.</p><p>He had to go up against fellow Group C performer Lizard in a Smackdown to “Movin’ Out (Anthony’s Song)”. Unfortunately, Spaghetti & Meatballs was eliminated from the competition, as Lizard got the chance to move on.</p><p>Final guesses from the panel about Spaghetti & Meatball’s identity included celebrity chefs such as Gordon Ramsay, Bobby Flay, and Guy Fieri, as well as actor and cooking show host Stanley Tucci. They were on the right track, but he actually turned out to be MasterChef‘s Joe Bastianich.</p><p>After he was unmasked, Bastianich shared that he’s had a passion for singing his whole life, so he jumped at the opportunity to appear on the Masked Singer stage this season.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AFGHAN HOUND UNMASKED ON ‘THE MASKED SINGER’S ‘WIZARD OF OZ’ NIGHT</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zGf9wr3HEE</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-poodle-moth-clock-impress-the-panel>Poodle Moth, Clock Impress the Panel</h2><p>Wednesday’s episode also featured two other new contestants in Group C — Poodle Moth and Clock. First up, Poodle Moth took the stage to perform “Just the Way You Are.” Like everyone else in this episode, they showed off an amazing vocal talent.</p><p>Poodle Moth teased that they’ve performed at the Grand Ole Opry, which makes us even more curious about who they might be. Guesses from the panel about Poodle Moth’s identity included Trisha Yearwood, Wynonna Judd, and Rita Wilson.</p><p>This week’s show also introduced us to Clock, who wowed the panel with their rendition of “Piano Man” and teased that they’ve performed for a president. Guesses included Anita Baker, Diana Ross, and Evelyn “Champagne” King.</p><p>What did you think of this week’s new episode of The Masked Singer?
