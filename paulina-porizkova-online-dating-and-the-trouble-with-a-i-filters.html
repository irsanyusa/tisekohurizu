Every night sometime between 3 and 4 am, massive commercial garbage haulers lumber up and down the street right underneath the bedroom brakes gnashing on trash lit up with twinkle lights like neon dinosaurs.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the time, I had a tiny baby and she’d wake up, of course, so I’d nurse her and watch those spectacular beasts from the window. They are spotless, decorated with swirly detailing all over, like tattoos with the nicknames of the drivers in quotes. And these trucks don’t just drive by throwing trash in the back, they stop, and backup, clattering around in the restaurant trash bins the compactor growling and churning for ages before they heave off to the next block.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The baby would watch the lights reflecting on the windows and it was a show for her—an early morning Brooklyn carnival. And it’s one reason my sister still brings earplugs when she visits.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But here’s the thing, the garbage dinosaurs didn’t wake me or the children after a few months. Our ears and brains filter them out now.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tonight I’m up late writing and I can hear the city beasties outside. I’d forgotten all about them. And it got me thinking about how powerful our internal filters are. Not only can we get used to anything rendering it invisible, but generally, we hear what we want to hear. I, for example, have a special filter that strains out nearly all compliments but saves even the tiniest criticism so that I can chew on it like the trucks.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And now our inner filters are aided by technological filters that govern what we see or don’t see. Everything from Netflix to shopping sites serve up what they think we want based on what we wanted before, or what we clicked on before. After I bought stretchy waisted men’s pants for my dad who was frail and couldn’t handle buttons, I was offered variations on that sartorial theme every single time I opened my email for months. I couldn’t convince Amazon that I was not a tall 80-year-old man.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Subscribe here to get a fresh edition of It’s Not Just You every week</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>This brings me unexpectedly to supermodel</strong> Paulina Porizkova who <a href=# rel=noopener>wrote a post on Instagram</a> this week about how she couldn’t convince a dating app called Hinge that she was herself. It seems as if its algorithmically driven filtering system blocks users who use the names of famous people, assuming they’re imposters. And no amount of emailing on her part could get her back on.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">You might remember Porizkova from the 1980s and 1990s. She’s 56 now, a writer who is still modeling, still stunning, and a fierce advocate of #nofilter photos that show the lines on her face. And after the death of her husband, she’s been dating for the first time since she was 19.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Men rushed into the comments of her recent post to ask her out, and to suggest other apps—shocked that she was both single and potentially on an app they could log into. Everyone reassured her that she was “still” gorgeous. (Ahem.) Though many women had variations on this comment: “If you need @Hinge to meet men there is seriously no help for the rest of us.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In her <a href=# rel=noopener>responses</a> to the comments, Porizkova said that actually, she’d tried other dating apps, and that for women her age, the dating pool was more like “a shallow pond.” And that sent everyone into a further tizzy, well because we cannot handle it when celebrities really are just like us.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But I have a radical theory on why hundreds of men weren’t asking the smart and lovely Paulina Porizkova out online.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">They didn’t see her. Because of…filters.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Many dating apps do something called “collaborative filtering” where their algorithm looks at users’ chosen filters, age and other preferences, and they combine it with what they know about who those same people actually click on.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So because of this, many men in their 40s and 50s do not even see women in their 50s when they go on dating sites. So even Porizkova was literally invisible to them. (All you need to know about the data behind this theory is this New York Times headline: “<a href=# rel=noopener>For Online Daters,</a> Women Peak at 18 While Men Peak at 50, Study Finds. Oy.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">These filters are not only depriving men of supermodels, but they may be reinforcing all kinds of biases and annihilating serendipity. More recently some dating companies pledged to remove so-called “ethnicity filters,” but added others like political views.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I’m not sure where that configuration leaves humanity. But science tells us that we are wired to value what we’re familiar with—both in dating and in products which is where advertising comes in. So if we see the same kinds of people, and the same stuff all the time, we’ll <a href=# rel=noopener>gravitate towards them</a>. They will seem better. It’s called the “<a href=# rel=noopener>exposure effect</a>” and it’s why coworkers so often fall for each other. And why an older woman’s face might look aberrant to someone who spends too much time in filtered waters.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This explains why according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Pew Research</a>, nearly half of those who use online dating apps are “frustrated.” It may also justify my recent affection for the grouchy old garbage trucks of Brooklyn. They’ve been invisible to me for years, but I’ll miss them when I leave.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Subscribe here to get a fresh edition of It’s Not Just You every week</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">COPING KIT ⛱️</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>More Couth Please</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>This charming piece </a>discusses why the ever-evolving English language often retains the negative iterations of words like “uncouth,” rather than the positive.
