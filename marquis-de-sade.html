His controversial writings, which combined philosophy with pornography, challenged contemporary societal norms and have continued to spark debate and controversy for more than two centuries.</p><p>Born into a noble family, de Sade led a life marked by scandal and legal troubles, largely due to his sexual exploits and libertine lifestyle. His most notorious works include "Justine" and "The 120 Days of Sodom," which depicted graphic sexual violence and explored themes of eroticism, pleasure, and pain.</p><p>De Sade spent much of his adult life in prison or in mental institutions, largely as a result of his scandalous behavior and controversial writings. His work was banned in France until the mid-20th century, and it continues to be the subject of debate among scholars, who often regard him as a radical libertarian philosopher or dismiss him as a mere pornographer.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>June 2</a>, <a href=#>1740</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Paris, France<br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Gemini</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>December 2</a>, <a href=#>1814</a> (aged 74)<br></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Career Highlights</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1777-02-13</a> Marquis de Sade arrested without charge, imprisoned in Vincennes fortress</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1784-02-29</a> Marquis de Sade transferred from Vincennes fortress to the Bastille</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1787-07-02</a> Marquis de Sade shouts from Bastille that prisoners are being slaughtered</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1794-09-21</a> <a href=#>Jean-Paul Marat</a>'s remains are transferred to the Panthéon in Paris, with the eulogy given by the Marquis de Sade</li></ul><h2>Personal Life</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1763-05-17</a> Philosopher Marquis de Sade (22) weds Renee Pelagie de Montreuil in Paris</li></ul><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinnqegobJwucCrqK6ho2KxpnnSmpue</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./projets-de-loi-dette-sociale-et-autonomie-la-cinquieme-branche-accelere-en-faisant-du-sur-place.html><span>←</span><span>la cinquime branche acclre... en faisant du sur-place</span></a>
