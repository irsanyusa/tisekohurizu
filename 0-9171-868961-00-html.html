Jacobowitz made his decision a few months ago: he would quit nerve-jangling Detroit (pop. 1,910,200), take his wife and child north to live the unadorned homesteader’s life near Moose Pass (pop."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
